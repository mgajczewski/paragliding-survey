Ballast & Fairness in Paragliding Competition survey aims at gathering opinions from pilots and other people involved in paragliding competitions on various approaches mitigating the over-ballasting issue in paragliding. Officially there were 4 solutions proposed:
- Equalizers by Luc Armant,
- Multi Radius Turpoint by Bruce Goldsmith,
- Weight classes (or categories) by Daniel Dimov,
- Weight check and ballast limits by CIVL Bureau.
Descriptions and details of these solutions were put in docs/knowledge.
The community discussions take place in a WhatsApp (stored in "docs/Whatsapp - Ballast free talks.txt") and on pages within "What went wrong" and "What we want" sections in GaggleReport platform (see links in docs/README.md). There were some Markdown documents created during these discussions, see docs folder.
Benefits and concerns regarding each solution, should be phrased to match high-level categories from docs/categories.md  update this document as well if needed.
