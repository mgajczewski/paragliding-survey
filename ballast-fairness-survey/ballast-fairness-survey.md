# ðŸ“‹ Survey: Ballast & Fairness in Paragliding Competition

## Introduction
Thank you for participating in this crucial survey.  
We are gathering data from pilots and designers to find a widely supported solution to the issues of excessive ballast, safety, and fairness in paragliding competitions.  

Your anonymous responses will help guide future rule-making and ensure the sport remains safe, fair, and inclusive.  
This survey should take approximately **10â€“15 minutes**.

## Section 3: Evaluating the Solutions
We will now ask your opinion on the main solutions proposed.

### Solution 1: "Equalizers" (Noodles)
*(As proposed by Luc Armant â€“ adding drag elements to larger wings to equalize glide performance across sizes)*

**9. How familiar are you with the "Equalizers" proposal?**  
- [ ] Not familiar  
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)  
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)  
- [ ] Very familiar (read the Gaggler report document)  

**10. Please rate your overall support for testing/implementing "Equalizers":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**11. What are your biggest concerns about "Equalizers"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Safety/Certification: Unsure how they affect handling, collapses, or SIV maneuvers.  
- [ ] Installation: Pilots might install them incorrectly, creating a safety risk.  
- [ ] Unfairness: Unfairly "punishes" heavier pilots who have no choice but to fly large wings.  
- [ ] Ineffective: Won't truly equalize performance (e.g., handling, climb).  
- [ ] Ineffective: Won't stop light pilots from ballasting up to M-sizes for better "comfort" or "handling."  
- [ ] Market: Won't actually incentivize manufacturers to build better small wings.  
- [ ] Philosophy: It feels "absurd" to intentionally add drag in a performance sport.  
- [ ] Other: __________  

**12. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Equalizers"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Levels the field: Makes performance more equal across wing sizes.  
- [ ] Reduces ballast: Removes the incentive for S/M pilots to ballast up to M/L sizes.  
- [ ] Promotes small wings: Creates a real incentive for manufacturers to develop better XS/S wings.  
- [ ] Keeps "Overall" ranking: Allows everyone to race together and preserves a single "Overall" winner.  
- [ ] Targeted solution: Directly addresses the performance gap without complex rule changes.  
- [ ] Other: __________  

---

### Solution 2: Weight Classes
*(Creating 4â€“6 distinct weight classes, e.g., "70â€“80kg," "80â€“90kg." This would likely replace a single "Overall" winner with winners for each class.)*

**13. Please rate your overall support for implementing "Weight Classes":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**14. What are your biggest concerns about "Weight Classes"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Loses "Overall" Winner: Destroys the prestige and simplicity of having one overall champion.  
- [ ] Logistics: Too complicated to manage (e.g., separate starts, scoring, prizes).  
- [ ] "Ballasting to the limit": Pilots will just carry ballast to be at the top of their 10kg-wide class.  
- [ ] Small Categories: Some classes might not have enough pilots to be competitive.  
- [ ] Enforcement: Requires strict weigh-ins, which are hard to manage and can be cheated (e.g., water loading).  
- [ ] Team/Nation: Complicates FAI-1 team selection and scoring.  
- [ ] Other: __________  

**15. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Weight Classes"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Ultimate Fairness: Pilots compete only against those of similar weight.  
- [ ] Eliminates Ballast: Creates a strong incentive to fly at one's "natural" weight.  
- [ ] Promotes Small Wings: Creates a protected, competitive market for XS/S wings.  
- [ ] Improves Safety: Massively reduces/eliminates the need for dangerous ballast loads.  
- [ ] Proven Concept: Works well in many other sports (e.g., boxing, sailing).  
- [ ] Other: __________  

---

### Solution 3: Strict Ballast Limitations
*(A simple rule, e.g., "Max 10kg of ballast allowed" or "Ballast cannot exceed 15% of body weight.")*

**16. Please rate your overall support for implementing "Strict Ballast Limitations":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**17. What are your biggest concerns about "Ballast Limitations"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Enforcement: Extremely difficult to enforce; pilots will hide ballast (lead in shoes, drinking water, heavy gear).  
- [ ] Unfair: Penalizes light pilots who need some ballast just to fly an S-size wing safely, while not affecting heavy pilots.  
- [ ] Doesn't solve it: Doesn't fix the reason pilots ballast (wing performance disparity). L-size pilots will still have an advantage.  
- [ ] Complicated: Creates "grey areas" (what counts as ballast vs. gear?).  
- [ ] Other: __________  

**18. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Ballast Limitations"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Simple Rule: Easy to understand (if not to enforce).  
- [ ] Directly addresses safety: Puts a hard stop on the most dangerous ballast loads.  
- [ ] Partial Incentive: May encourage some pilots to move to a smaller wing.  
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 4: MRT (Multiple Radius Turnpoints) Scoring
*(A scoring adjustment based on wing size/AUW, as described on Gaggler.org.)*

**19. How familiar are you with the "MRT" proposal?**  
- [ ] Not familiar  
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)  
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)  
- [ ] Very familiar (read the Gaggler report document)  

**20. Please rate your overall support for testing/implementing "MRT":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**21. What are your biggest concerns about "MRT"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Randomness: Interferes with gaggle flying; scoring becomes "random" depending on group composition.  
- [ ] Safety: May create "unexpected turns in a large group."  
- [ ] Too Complex: The formula is opaque, and pilots won't understand how they are being scored.  
- [ ] Wrong Focus: Moves the sport away from racing "against each other" (which pilots enjoy).  
- [ ] Ineffective: A scoring "fix" doesn't solve the physical problem of pilots carrying dangerous ballast.  
- [ ] Other: __________  

**22. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "MRT"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Removes Ballast Incentive: Directly compensates for wing size performance, making ballast unnecessary.  
- [ ] Keeps "Overall" ranking: Allows everyone to race together and preserves a single "Overall" winner.  
- [ ] No physical modification: Doesn't require adding "noodles" or new gear.  
- [ ] Other: __________

- __ Strict Ballast Limitations (e.g., max 10kg)  
- __ MRT (Multiple Radius Turnpoints scoring)  
- __ Separate "Lightweight" Class (e.g., <95kg, like the "Reynolds" class, but "Overall" winner still exists)  
- __ No Change (Status Quo)  

**24. A separate, but related, safety issue discussed is the design of modern harnesses (e.g., "submarine" types). How do you prioritize this?**  
- [ ] The harness safety issue is more urgent than the ballast issue and should be fixed first.  
- [ ] The harness safety issue is equally urgent as the ballast issue.  
- [ ] The harness safety issue is less urgent than the ballast issue.  
- [ ] The two issues are separate and should be addressed independently.
