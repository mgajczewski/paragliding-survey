# 📋 Survey: Ballast & Fairness in Paragliding Competition

## Introduction
Thank you for participating in this crucial survey.  
We are gathering data from pilots and designers to find a widely supported solution to the issues of excessive ballast, safety, and fairness in paragliding competitions.  

Your anonymous responses will help guide future rule-making and ensure the sport remains safe, fair, and inclusive.  
This survey should take approximately **10–15 minutes**.

## Section 2: Problem Perception
How do you see the current situation?

For a detailed overview, see [The Paragliding Ballast Issue on gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/issue).

**6. On a scale of 1 to 5, how significant is the safety risk associated with pilots carrying large amounts of ballast?**  
- (1) Not significant  
- (2) Slightly significant  
- (3) Moderately significant  
- (4) Very significant  
- (5) Extremely significant (a critical issue)  

**7. On a scale of 1 to 5, how significant is the competitive fairness issue related to pilot weight and ballasting?**  
- (1) Not an issue

- (3) Moderate issue  
- (4) Significant issue  
- (5) Extremely unfair (a critical issue)  

**8. Which statement best reflects your personal philosophy?**  
- [ ] Paragliding competition should be about pilot skill and decision-making; rules should actively equalize advantages/disadvantages from body weight.  
- [ ] Physical attributes (like weight) are a natural part of any sport; rules should not try to compensate for these differences.  
- [ ] Rules should only intervene to address extreme safety risks (like >20kg ballast), but should not try to engineer competitive fairness.

## Section 3: Evaluating the Solutions
We will now ask your opinion on the main solutions proposed.

### Solution 1: "Equalizers" (Noodles)
*(As proposed by Luc Armant – adding drag elements to larger wings to equalize glide performance across sizes)*

**9. How familiar are you with the "Equalizers" proposal?**  
- [ ] Not familiar  
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)  
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)  
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Luc Armant's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JtOCo8KPJFEnUb9y4QFlR8YdcKHp1-1n/view?usp=drivesdk), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers))  

**10. Please rate your overall support for testing/implementing "Equalizers":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**11. What are your biggest concerns about "Equalizers"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Safety/Certification: Unsure how they affect handling, collapses, or SIV maneuvers (answered in [FAQ](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers)).  
- [ ] Liability/Certification: Could affect EN/CCC certification status; organizers mandating them may face liability in the event of an incident (should be answered in [FAQ](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers)).  
- [ ] Safety/Installation: Pilots might install them incorrectly, creating a safety risk.  
- [ ] Unfairness: Unfairly "punishes" heavier pilots who have no choice but to fly large wings.  
- [ ] Ineffective: Won't truly equalize performance (e.g., handling, stability, climb), as it oversimplifies complex performance differences between sizes.
- [ ] Safety: Won't stop light pilots from ballasting up with potentially unsafe amounts of weight.
- [ ] Market: Won't actually incentivize manufacturers to create and improve XS and smaller wings.  
- [ ] Market Stagnation: Reinforces the dominant glider model, reducing incentives for innovation and diversification.
- [ ] Technological Stagnation: Standardizes the sport around a single design, slowing technical evolution and suppressing alternative designs.
- [ ] Philosophy: It feels "absurd" to intentionally add drag in a performance sport.  
- [ ] Gaming the system: The equalizer formula could incentivize manufacturers to strategically set the maximum take-off weight to gain a competitive edge.
- [ ] Ineffective/Over-penalizing: The fixed drag penalty may be too high in weak conditions, unfairly disadvantaging larger wings.
- [ ] Ineffective/Hard to Calibrate: It is difficult to accurately measure and prove that the chosen compensation is fair—not too little and not too much.
- [ ] Unfairness/Other factors: Ignores other performance variables like pilot body drag or harness aerodynamics (e.g., penalizing safer, bulkier harnesses).
- [ ] Logistics: Creates overhead for organizers to distribute, verify, and manage equalizers during competitions.
- [ ] Other: __________  

**12. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Equalizers"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Levels the field: Makes performance more equal across wing sizes.
- [ ] Improves Safety: Reduces the incentive for XS/S pilots to ballast up to M/L sizes.
- [ ] Promotes small wings: Creates a real incentive for manufacturers to develop better XS/S wings.
- [ ] Promotes micro sizes: Incentivizes the creation and improvement of competitive XXS/XXXS glider sizes.
- [ ] Promotes intermediate sizes: Could encourage a wider range of wing sizes, matching equalizer gradations.
- [ ] Promotes lightweight gear: By removing the performance incentive for weight, it encourages innovation in lighter competition equipment (harnesses, reserves).
- [ ] Keeps "Overall" ranking: Allows everyone to race together and preserves a single "Overall" winner.
- [ ] Fairness: Directly addresses the performance gap between wing sizes.
- [ ] Simple to Implement: Avoids complex changes to rules or scoring systems.
- [ ] Preserves Gaggle Flying: Does not interfere with gaggle flying dynamics, a key aspect of modern competition.
- [ ] Tunable: The equalizer formula can be adjusted and fine-tuned based on real-world data and feedback.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 2: Partial Weight Class (A separate "Lightweight" Category)
*(As proposed by Daniel Dimov – adding at least one "Lightweight" category (e.g., <95kg AUW) to competitions as a first step to improve inclusivity without eliminating the single overall champion. Pilots in this class would compete for both a "Lightweight" title and the traditional "Overall" title, preserving a single overall champion.)*

**13. How familiar are you with the "Partial Weight Class" proposal?**
- [ ] Not familiar
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Daniel Dimov's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19pRWjT8BSasdm8NyVDOPxrzQqD5N0oDw/view), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/node/22))

**14. Please rate your overall support for implementing a "Partial Weight Class":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**15. What are your biggest concerns about a "Partial Weight Class"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Dilutes "Overall" Title: A separate podium could reduce the prestige of the overall winner.
- [ ] Safety: An incomplete solution, as very light pilots may still need unsafe amounts of ballast.
- [ ] Insufficient Incentive: The "Overall" title remains more prestigious, so pilots may still carry excessive ballast to compete for it rather than the lightweight category.
- [ ] Arbitrary Cutoff: The weight cutoff (e.g., 95kg) is arbitrary and might not be based on sufficient data.
- [ ] Community Fragmentation: Risks splitting the pilot community.
- [ ] Diluted Competition: Creates small, uncompetitive fields, especially when combined with existing glider classes.
- [ ] Ineffectiveness: May not change behavior, as pilots may still prioritize the “Overall” title.
- [ ] Devalues Competition: Multiple podiums may be seen as lowering the prestige of winning.
- [ ] Unfair Scoring Dynamics: Lightweight pilots could gain unfair advantages (e.g., in leading points) by flying with heavier gaggles, questioning the legitimacy of their category win.
- [ ] Other: __________

**16. What do you see as the biggest benefits of a "Partial Weight Class"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Improves Safety: Gives many lighter pilots a competitive option without needing dangerous amounts of ballast.
- [ ] Improves Inclusivity: Encourages more light pilots and women to participate.
- [ ] Promotes Small Wings: Creates market demand for high-performance small gliders.
- [ ] Additional Option: Provides another competitive option for pilots who are too light.
- [ ] Simple to Implement: Easy to implement and test without major rule changes.
- [ ] Simple to Verify: Can be based on glider's certified weight range, avoiding complex pilot weigh-ins.
- [ ] Improves Pilot Motivation: Offers a tangible goal for a wider range of pilots, increasing engagement and satisfaction.
- [ ] Positive Precedent: The model has been well-received in some competition series (e.g. SRS), where pilots are reportedly happy with the system.
- [ ] Non-Invasive: Implemented through scoring and logistics, without requiring physical modifications to gliders or changes to race routes.
- [ ] Preserves "Overall" Winner: Keeps the traditional structure of a single overall champion.
- [ ] Preserves Ranking: Keeps the "Overall" WPRS ranking and just introduces another filter.
- [ ] Other: __________

---

### Solution 3: Comprehensive Weight Classes (Multi-Winner System)
*(This approach would create multiple weight categories (e.g., every 10kg), with each crowning its own champion. This would potentially replace the single "Overall" winner with multiple champions. As described on [gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/weight-categories).)*

**17. Please rate your overall support for implementing "Comprehensive Weight Classes":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**18. What are your biggest concerns about "Comprehensive Weight Classes"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Loses "Overall" Winner: Destroys the prestige and simplicity of having one overall champion.
- [ ] Community Fragmentation: Risks splitting the pilot community into separate groups.
- [ ] Complicates Women's Category: Risks undermining the existing women's category, as female pilots would be split across classes or still incentivized to ballast up for a separate "Overall Women" title.
- [ ] Diluted Competition: Creates small, uncompetitive fields, especially when combined with existing glider classes.
- [ ] Devalues Titles: Having many champions reduces the value of each title.
- [ ] Logistics: Too complicated to manage (e.g., separate starts, scoring, prizes).
- [ ] Team Scoring: Complicates FAI-1 team selection and scoring.
- [ ] Ranking Fragmentation: Requires a major WPRS overhaul. Scoring classes as separate events would yield low points, devaluing titles and complicating pilot comparisons.
- [ ] Enforcement: Requires strict weigh-ins, which are hard to manage and can be cheated (e.g., water loading).
- [ ] Unfair Scoring Dynamics: Lighter pilots could gain unfair advantages (e.g., in leading points) by flying with heavier gaggles, questioning the legitimacy of their category win.
- [ ] Other: __________


**19. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Comprehensive Weight Classes"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Improves Safety: Gives all pilots a class they can fly in with little to no ballast.
- [ ] Maximizes Fairness: Pilots only compete against others with a similar all-up weight.
- [ ] Promotes Innovation: Creates market demand for high-performance wings across all size categories.
- [ ] Promotes Small Wings: Specifically creates a protected, competitive market for XXS/XS wings which currently seem to be underdeveloped.
- [ ] Proven Concept: Works well in many other sports (e.g., boxing, sailing).
- [ ] Simple to Verify: Can be based on glider's certified weight range, avoiding complex pilot weigh-ins.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 4: Strict Ballast Limitations
*(A simple rule limiting ballast (e.g., "Max 10kg," or "cannot exceed 15% of body weight"). As described on [gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/weight-checks).)*

**20. Please rate your overall support for implementing "Strict Ballast Limitations":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**21. What are your biggest concerns about "Ballast Limitations"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Enforcement: Difficult to enforce fairly and consistently, leading to random penalties.
- [ ] Unfair: Penalizes light pilots who need some ballast just to fly an S-size wing safely, while not affecting heavy pilots.  
- [ ] Unfairness: Doesn't fix the core performance disparity; larger wings will still have an advantage.
- [ ] Complicated: Creates "grey areas" (what counts as ballast vs. gear?).
- [ ] Safety: Doesn't solve the core issue of heavy gear; 28-33kg of equipment is still very heavy and poses a risk.
- [ ] Discourages Participation: May push lighter pilots who feel unfairly handicapped out of top-level competition.
- [ ] Ethics: Encourages unsafe and unethical behavior like unhealthy dieting, water-loading before checks, steroid use, and hiding ballast.
- [ ] Other: __________  

**22. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Ballast Limitations"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Simple Rule: Easy to understand (if not to enforce).  
- [ ] Improves Safety: Puts a hard stop on the most dangerous ballast loads.
- [ ] Improves Pilot Retention: May encourage top lightweight pilots who have left the sport due to safety concerns to return.
- [ ] Partial Incentive: May encourage some pilots to move to a smaller wing.  
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 5: MRT (Multiple Radius Turnpoints)
*(A route-based handicap system where pilots have different turnpoint radii based on their all-up weight. Heavier pilots fly a longer route, equalizing the task in real-time rather than through post-task scoring adjustments. As described on [gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/mrt).)*

**23. How familiar are you with the "MRT" proposal?**  
- [ ] Not familiar  
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)  
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)  
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Burce Goldsmith's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pz5mvHPNHuikB4BfBoDI-RbNyrvNfWos/view?usp=drivesdk), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/mrt))  

**24. Please rate your overall support for testing/implementing "MRT":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**25. What are your biggest concerns about "MRT"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Tactical Complexity: Hard to assess your position and make tactical decisions.
- [ ] Randomness: Scoring becomes "random" depending on group composition and who you fly with.
- [ ] Disrupts Gaggle Flying: Undermines the key skill of effective gaggle flying by disrupting natural group dynamics.
- [ ] Task Setter Dependency: Fairness relies heavily on perfect task design.
- [ ] Task Design Limitations: Relies on specific task design (e.g., cannot be used on straight-to-goal tasks, or in the first/last 10km of a race) and requires specially trained task setters.
- [ ] Safety: Creates unpredictable crossing tracks within gaggles near turnpoints.
- [ ] Spectator Unfriendly: Difficult for viewers to follow when the lead changes constantly.
- [ ] Changes Scoring: Works best without leading points, a fundamental change.
- [ ] Ineffective on Safety: Doesn't solve the physical problem of dangerous ballast.
- [ ] Complexity: Route-generation formula is opaque and hard for pilots to understand.
- [ ] Unfair Turnpoint Placement: Fairness can be compromised if a turnpoint is placed in a known thermal, nullifying the advantage for lighter pilots.
- [ ] Devalues Titles: It could diminish the prestige of a World or Continental Champion title.
- [ ] Other: __________  

**26. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "MRT"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Improves Safety: Directly compensates for wing size performance, discouraging the use of large amounts of ballast.
- [ ] Keeps "Overall" ranking: Allows everyone to race together and preserves a single "Overall" winner.
- [ ] No physical modification: Doesn't require adding "noodles" or new gear.
- [ ] Levels the playing field: Makes performance more equal across different pilot weights.
- [ ] Provides tactical equality: Gives lighter pilots a realistic chance to be in the lead gaggle and win tasks.
- [ ] Enhances pilot engagement: Makes racing more motivating and enjoyable for a wider range of pilots.
- [ ] Promotes XC skills: Shifts focus from pure gaggle racing to individual pilot skills against the elements.
- [ ] Modernizes Scoring: Removes the need for controversial leading points, which are seen to favor heavier pilots.
- [ ] Leverages existing technology: Supported by current scoring software, making it easier to implement.
- [ ] Good for other classes: Can be adapted to help lower-performance classes (e.g., Sport Class) to fly more of the task and be more competitive.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 6: Hybrid System (Single & Multi-Winner Leagues)
*(As proposed by Malin Lobb - creating two parallel competition leagues. Pilots could choose to compete in "Single Winner" events (either "open" or with "Equalizers"/"MRT") feeding a traditional Overall WPRS, OR in "Multi-Winner" events with weight classes and a separate WPRS.)*

**27. Please rate your overall support for implementing this "Hybrid System":**
*(For example, some competitions could be "Open" (status quo), some could use "Equalizers" and some could be "Weight Class" events, with pilots choosing which to attend.)*
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**28. What are your biggest concerns about a "Hybrid System"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Dilutes Competition: Splits the pilot pool, potentially weakening the quality of both leagues.
- [ ] Community Fragmentation: Risks splitting the pilot community.
- [ ] Too Complicated: Two separate ranking systems would be confusing for pilots and organizers.
- [ ] Devalues "Champion" Title: The existence of multiple top-level rankings could devalue the achievement of winning either.
- [ ] Resource Intensive: Requires more overhead for CIVL/FAI to manage two distinct WPRS systems.
- [ ] Ineffective: The "Single Winner" league may remain more prestigious, meaning pilots will still carry excessive ballast to compete for the "Overall" title rather than the multi-winner categories.
- [ ] Ranking Devaluation: Events in the "Multi-Winner" league would have fewer participants per category, resulting in lower WPRS points and making them less attractive.
- [ ] Organizer Reluctance: Competition organizers may be unwilling to manage the complexity of two parallel systems, limiting pilot choice.
- [ ] Other: __________

**29. What do you see as the biggest benefits of a "Hybrid System"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Pilot Choice: Offers pilots the freedom to choose the competition format that suits them best.
- [ ] Solves the Problem for Those Who Want It: Allows pilots who feel strongly about weight fairness to compete in a dedicated league without forcing a single solution on everyone.
- [ ] Evolutionary Approach: Lets the community decide over time which format is more popular and successful.
- [ ] Preserves Tradition: Keeps the "Overall" champion concept intact for those who value it.
- [ ] Other: __________
