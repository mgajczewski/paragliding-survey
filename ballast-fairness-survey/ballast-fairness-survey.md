# 📋 Survey: Ballast & Fairness in Paragliding Competition

## Introduction
Thank you for participating in this crucial survey.  
We are gathering data from pilots and designers to find a widely supported solution to the issues of excessive ballast, safety, and fairness in paragliding competitions.  

Your anonymous responses will help guide future rule-making and ensure the sport remains safe, fair, and inclusive.  
This survey should take approximately **10–15 minutes**.

## Section 3: Evaluating the Solutions
We will now ask your opinion on the main solutions proposed.

### Solution 1: "Equalizers" (Noodles)
*(As proposed by Luc Armant – adding drag elements to larger wings to equalize glide performance across sizes)*

**9. How familiar are you with the "Equalizers" proposal?**  
- [ ] Not familiar  
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)  
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)  
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Luc Armant's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JtOCo8KPJFEnUb9y4QFlR8YdcKHp1-1n/view?usp=drivesdk), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers))  

**10. Please rate your overall support for testing/implementing "Equalizers":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**11. What are your biggest concerns about "Equalizers"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Safety/Certification: Unsure how they affect handling, collapses, or SIV maneuvers (answered in [FAQ](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers)).  
- [ ] Liability/Certification: Could affect EN/CCC certification status; organizers mandating them may face liability in the event of an incident (should be answered in [FAQ](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers)).  
- [ ] Safety/Installation: Pilots might install them incorrectly, creating a safety risk.  
- [ ] Unfairness: Unfairly "punishes" heavier pilots who have no choice but to fly large wings.  
- [ ] Ineffective: Won't truly equalize performance (e.g., handling, climb).  
- [ ] Ineffective: Won't stop light pilots from ballasting up to M-sizes for better "comfort" or "handling."  
- [ ] Market: Won't actually incentivize manufacturers to build better small wings.  
- [ ] Market Stagnation: Reinforces the dominant glider model, reducing incentives for innovation and diversification.
- [ ] Technological Stagnation: Standardizes the sport around a single design, slowing technical evolution and suppressing alternative designs.
- [ ] Philosophy: It feels "absurd" to intentionally add drag in a performance sport.  
- [ ] Other: __________  

**12. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Equalizers"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Levels the field: Makes performance more equal across wing sizes.
- [ ] Reduces ballast: Reduces the incentive for S/M pilots to ballast up to M/L sizes.
- [ ] Promotes small wings: Creates a real incentive for manufacturers to develop better XS/S wings.
- [ ] Promotes micro sizes: Incentivizes the creation and improvement of competitive XXS/XXXS glider sizes.
- [ ] Promotes intermediate sizes: Could encourage a wider range of wing sizes, matching equalizer gradations.
- [ ] Keeps "Overall" ranking: Allows everyone to race together and preserves a single "Overall" winner.
- [ ] Targeted solution: Directly addresses the performance gap without complex rule changes.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 2: Partial Weight Class (A separate "Lightweight" Category)
*(As proposed by Daniel Dimov – adding at least one "Lightweight" category (e.g., <95kg AUW) to competitions as a first step to improve inclusivity without eliminating the single overall champion. Pilots in this class would compete for both a "Lightweight" title and the traditional "Overall" title, preserving a single overall champion.)*

**13. How familiar are you with the "Partial Weight Class" proposal?**
- [ ] Not familiar
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Daniel Dimov's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19pRWjT8BSasdm8NyVDOPxrzQqD5N0oDw/view), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/node/22))

**14. Please rate your overall support for implementing a "Partial Weight Class":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**15. What are your biggest concerns about a "Partial Weight Class"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Dilutes "Overall" Title: A separate podium could reduce the prestige of the overall winner.
- [ ] Incomplete Solution: With only one class, very light pilots may still need significant ballast to reach the class limit.
- [ ] Insufficient Incentive: The "Overall" title remains more prestigious, so pilots may still carry excessive ballast to compete for it rather than the lightweight category.
- [ ] Arbitrary Cutoff: The weight cutoff (e.g., 95kg) is arbitrary and might not be based on sufficient data.
- [ ] Community Fragmentation: Risks splitting the pilot community.
- [ ] Diluted Competition: Could create a less competitive field in the new class.
- [ ] Other: __________

**16. What do you see as the biggest benefits of a "Partial Weight Class"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Reduces Excessive Ballast: Gives many lighter pilots a competitive option without needing dangerous amounts of ballast.
- [ ] Improves Inclusivity: Encourages more light pilots and women to participate.
- [ ] Promotes Small Wings: Creates market demand for high-performance small gliders.
- [ ] Additional Option: Provides another competitive option for pilots who are too light.
- [ ] Simple to Implement: Easy to implement and test without major rule changes.
- [ ] Simple to Verify: Can be based on glider's certified weight range, avoiding complex pilot weigh-ins.
- [ ] Preserves "Overall" Winner: Keeps the traditional structure of a single overall champion.
- [ ] Preserves Ranking: Keeps the "Overall" WPRS ranking and just introduces another filter.
- [ ] Other: __________

---

### Solution 3: Comprehensive Weight Classes (Multi-Winner System)
*(This approach would create multiple weight categories, e.g., every 10kg. Each category would crown its own champion, potentially replacing the single "Overall" winner with multiple champions.)*

**17. Please rate your overall support for implementing "Comprehensive Weight Classes":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**18. What are your biggest concerns about "Comprehensive Weight Classes"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Loses "Overall" Winner: Destroys the prestige and simplicity of having one overall champion.
- [ ] Community Fragmentation: Risks splitting the pilot community into separate groups.
- [ ] Diluted Competition: Could lead to small, uncompetitive fields in some classes.
- [ ] Devalues Titles: Having many champions reduces the value of each title.
- [ ] Logistics: Too complicated to manage (e.g., separate starts, scoring, prizes).
- [ ] Team Scoring: Complicates FAI-1 team selection and scoring.
- [ ] Ranking Fragmentation: Requires separate WPRS rankings per weight class, complicating comparability and disrupting points continuity when pilots move between classes.
- [ ] Enforcement: Requires strict weigh-ins, which are hard to manage and can be cheated (e.g., water loading).
- [ ] Other: __________


**19. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Comprehensive Weight Classes"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Reduces Excessive Ballast: Gives all pilots a class they can fly in with little to no ballast.
- [ ] Maximizes Fairness: Pilots only compete against others with a similar all-up weight.
- [ ] Promotes Innovation: Creates market demand for high-performance wings across all size categories.
- [ ] Promotes Small Wings: Specifically creates a protected, competitive market for XXS/XS wings which currently seem to be underdeveloped.
- [ ] Proven Concept: Works well in many other sports (e.g., boxing, sailing).
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 4: Strict Ballast Limitations
*(A simple rule, e.g., "Max 10kg of ballast allowed" or "Ballast cannot exceed 15% of body weight.")*

**20. Please rate your overall support for implementing "Strict Ballast Limitations":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**21. What are your biggest concerns about "Ballast Limitations"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Enforcement: Extremely difficult to enforce; pilots will hide ballast (lead in shoes, drinking water, heavy gear).  
- [ ] Unfair: Penalizes light pilots who need some ballast just to fly an S-size wing safely, while not affecting heavy pilots.  
- [ ] Doesn't solve it: Doesn't fix the reason pilots ballast (wing performance disparity). L-size pilots will still have an advantage.  
- [ ] Complicated: Creates "grey areas" (what counts as ballast vs. gear?).  
- [ ] Other: __________  

**22. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Ballast Limitations"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Simple Rule: Easy to understand (if not to enforce).  
- [ ] Directly addresses safety: Puts a hard stop on the most dangerous ballast loads.  
- [ ] Partial Incentive: May encourage some pilots to move to a smaller wing.  
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 5: MRT (Multiple Radius Turnpoints)
*(A scoring adjustment using turnpoint radius modifications based on the pilot's all-up weight, as described on [gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/mrt).)*

**23. How familiar are you with the "MRT" proposal?**  
- [ ] Not familiar  
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)  
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)  
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Burce Goldsmith's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pz5mvHPNHuikB4BfBoDI-RbNyrvNfWos/view?usp=drivesdk), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/mrt))  

**24. Please rate your overall support for testing/implementing "MRT":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**25. What are your biggest concerns about "MRT"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] Randomness: Interferes with gaggle flying; scoring becomes "random" depending on group composition.  
- [ ] Safety: May create "unexpected turns in a large group."  
- [ ] Too Complex: The formula is opaque, and pilots won't understand how they are being scored.  
- [ ] Wrong Focus: Moves the sport away from racing "against each other" (which pilots enjoy).  
- [ ] Ineffective: A scoring "fix" doesn't solve the physical problem of pilots carrying dangerous ballast.  
- [ ] Task Setter Dependency: Fairness heavily depends on the skill of the task committee to design appropriate routes.
- [ ] Other: __________  

**26. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "MRT"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Reduces Ballast: Directly compensates for wing size performance, making large amounts of ballast unnecessary.
- [ ] Keeps "Overall" ranking: Allows everyone to race together and preserves a single "Overall" winner.
- [ ] No physical modification: Doesn't require adding "noodles" or new gear.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 6: Hybrid System (Single & Multi-Winner Leagues)
*(As proposed by Malin Lobb - creating two parallel competition leagues. Pilots could choose to compete in "Single Winner" events (either "open" or with "Equalizers"/"MRT") feeding a traditional Overall WPRS, OR in "Multi-Winner" events with weight classes and a separate WPRS.)*

**27. Please rate your overall support for implementing this "Hybrid System":**
*(For example, some competitions could be "Open" (status quo), some could use "Equalizers," and some could be "Weight Class" events, with pilots choosing which to attend.)*
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**28. What are your biggest concerns about a "Hybrid System"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Dilutes Competition: Splits the pilot pool, potentially weakening the quality of both leagues.
- [ ] Community Fragmentation: Risks splitting the pilot community.
- [ ] Too Complicated: Two separate ranking systems would be confusing for pilots and organizers.
- [ ] Devalues "Champion" Title: The existence of multiple top-level rankings could devalue the achievement of winning either.
- [ ] Resource Intensive: Requires more overhead for CIVL/FAI to manage two distinct WPRS systems.
- [ ] Other: __________

**29. What do you see as the biggest benefits of a "Hybrid System"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] Pilot Choice: Offers pilots the freedom to choose the competition format that suits them best.
- [ ] Solves the Problem for Those Who Want It: Allows pilots who feel strongly about weight fairness to compete in a dedicated league without forcing a single solution on everyone.
- [ ] Evolutionary Approach: Lets the community decide over time which format is more popular and successful.
- [ ] Preserves Tradition: Keeps the "Overall" champion concept intact for those who value it.
- [ ] Other: __________
