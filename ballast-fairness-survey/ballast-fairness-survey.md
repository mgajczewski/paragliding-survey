# 📋 Survey: Ballast & Fairness in Paragliding Competition

## Introduction
Thank you for participating in this crucial survey on ballast and fairness in paragliding competitions.

The issue of pilots carrying excessive ballast has sparked a significant debate within our community, raising concerns about safety, fairness, and the core principles of our sport. In response, several solutions have been proposed to address these challenges.

This survey aims to gather opinions from pilots, designers, and other stakeholders on these proposed solutions. Your anonymous feedback is vital for guiding the future of competition rule-making, helping us find a widely supported path forward that ensures our sport remains safe, fair, and inclusive for all.

The survey is divided into four sections:
1.  **About You:** Basic demographic data to help us analyze the results.
2.  **Problem Perception:** Your views on the severity of the ballast and fairness issues.
3.  **Evaluating the Solutions:** Your feedback on six distinct proposals aimed at resolving these issues.
4.  **Priorities:** A final ranking of the solutions and your perspective on related topics.

Completing the survey should take approximately **15-20 minutes**.

## Section 2: Problem Perception
How do you see the current situation?

For a detailed overview, see [The Paragliding Ballast Issue on gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/issue).

**9. On a scale of 1 to 5, how significant is the safety risk associated with pilots carrying large amounts of ballast?**  
- (1) Not significant  
- (2) Slightly significant  
- (3) Moderately significant  
- (4) Very significant  
- (5) Extremely significant (a critical issue)  

**10. On a scale of 1 to 5, how significant is the competitive fairness issue related to pilot weight and ballasting?**  
- (1) Not an issue  
- (2) Slight issue  
- (3) Moderate issue  
- (4) Significant issue  
- (5) Extremely unfair (a critical issue)  

**11. Which statement best reflects your personal philosophy?**  
- [ ] Paragliding competition should be about pilot skill and decision-making; rules should actively equalize advantages/disadvantages from body weight.  
- [ ] Physical attributes (like weight) are a natural part of any sport; rules should not try to compensate for these differences.  
- [ ] Rules should only intervene to address extreme safety risks (like >20kg ballast), but should not try to engineer competitive fairness.

## Section 3: Evaluating the Solutions
We will now ask your opinion on the main solutions proposed.

### Solution 1: "Equalizers"
*(As proposed by Luc Armant – adding drag elements to larger wings to equalize glide performance across sizes)*

**12. How familiar are you with the "Equalizers" proposal?**  
- [ ] Not familiar  
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)  
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)  
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Luc Armant's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JtOCo8KPJFEnUb9y4QFlR8YdcKHp1-1n/view?usp=drivesdk), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers))  

**13. Please rate your overall support for testing/implementing "Equalizers":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**14. What are your biggest concerns about "Equalizers"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] 🛡️ Unsure how they affect handling, collapses, or SIV maneuvers (answered in [FAQ](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers)).  
- [ ] 🛡️ Could affect EN/CCC certification status; organizers mandating them may face liability in the event of an incident (should be answered in [FAQ](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers)).  
- [ ] 🛡️ Pilots might install them incorrectly, creating a safety risk.  
- [ ] 🛡️ Won't stop light pilots from ballasting up with potentially unsafe amounts of weight.
- [ ] ⚖️ Unfairly "punishes" heavier pilots who have no choice but to fly large wings.  
- [ ] ⚖️ Won't truly equalize performance (e.g., handling, stability, climb), as it oversimplifies complex performance differences between sizes.
- [ ] ⚖️ The fixed drag penalty may be too high in weak conditions, unfairly disadvantaging larger wings.
- [ ] ⚖️ Ignores other performance variables like pilot body drag or harness aerodynamics (e.g., penalizing safer, bulkier harnesses).
- [ ] 🛠️ The equalizer formula could incentivize manufacturers to strategically set the maximum take-off weight to gain a competitive edge.
- [ ] 🛠️ It is difficult to accurately measure and prove that the chosen compensation is fair—not too little and not too much.
- [ ] 🛠️ Creates overhead for organizers to distribute, verify, and manage equalizers during competitions.
- [ ] 🚀 Won't actually incentivize manufacturers to create and improve XS and smaller wings.  
- [ ] 🚀 Reinforces the dominant glider model, reducing incentives for innovation and diversification.
- [ ] 🚀 Standardizes the sport around a single design, slowing technical evolution and suppressing alternative designs.
- [ ] 👥 It feels "absurd" to intentionally add drag in a performance sport.
- [ ] 👥 Psychologically frustrating to intentionally add drag to performance equipment.
- [ ] Other: __________  

**15. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Equalizers"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] 🛡️ Reduces the incentive for XS/S pilots to ballast up to M/L sizes.
- [ ] ⚖️ Makes performance more equal across wing sizes.
- [ ] ⚖️ Directly addresses the performance gap between wing sizes.
- [ ] 🏆 Allows everyone to race together and preserves a single "Overall" winner.
- [ ] 🛠️ Avoids complex changes to rules or scoring systems.
- [ ] 🛠️ The equalizer formula can be adjusted and fine-tuned based on real-world data and feedback.
- [ ] 🚀 Creates a real incentive for manufacturers to develop better XS/S wings.
- [ ] 🚀 Incentivizes the creation and improvement of competitive XXS/XXXS glider sizes.
- [ ] 🚀 Could encourage a wider range of wing sizes, matching equalizer gradations.
- [ ] 🚀 By removing the performance incentive for weight, it encourages innovation in lighter competition equipment (harnesses, reserves).
- [ ] 👥 Allows all pilots to fly the same task together, avoiding division into separate categories.
- [ ] 👥 Doesn't interfere with the tactical dynamics of group flying.
- [ ] 👥 Does not interfere with gaggle flying dynamics, a key aspect of modern competition.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 2: Partial Weight Class (A separate "Lightweight" Category)
*(As proposed by Daniel Dimov – adding at least one "Lightweight" category (e.g., <95kg takeoff weight) to competitions as a first step to improve inclusivity without eliminating the single overall champion. Pilots in this class would compete for both a "Lightweight" title and the traditional "Overall" title, preserving a single overall champion.)*

**16. How familiar are you with the "Partial Weight Class" proposal?**
- [ ] Not familiar
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Daniel Dimov's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19pRWjT8BSasdm8NyVDOPxrzQqD5N0oDw/view), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/node/22))

**17. Please rate your overall support for implementing a "Partial Weight Class":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**18. What are your biggest concerns about a "Partial Weight Class"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] 🛡️ An incomplete solution, as very light pilots may still need unsafe amounts of ballast.
- [ ] ⚖️ The weight cutoff (e.g., 95kg) is arbitrary and might not be based on sufficient data.
- [ ] ⚖️ May not change behavior, as pilots may still prioritize the “Overall” title.
- [ ] ⚖️ Lightweight pilots could gain unfair advantages (e.g., in leading points) by flying with heavier gaggles, questioning the legitimacy of their category win.
- [ ] 🏆 A separate podium could reduce the prestige of the overall winner.
- [ ] 🏆 Creates small, uncompetitive fields, especially when combined with existing glider classes.
- [ ] 🏆 Multiple podiums may be seen as lowering the prestige of winning.
- [ ] 👥 The "Overall" title remains more prestigious, so pilots may still carry excessive ballast to compete for it rather than the lightweight category.
- [ ] 👥 Risks splitting the pilot community.
- [ ] Other: __________

**19. What do you see as the biggest benefits of a "Partial Weight Class"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] 🛡️ Gives many lighter pilots a competitive option without needing dangerous amounts of ballast.
- [ ] 🏆 Keeps the traditional structure of a single overall champion.
- [ ] 🏆 Keeps the "Overall" WPRS ranking and just introduces another filter.
- [ ] 🛠️ Easy to implement and test without major rule changes.
- [ ] 🛠️ Can be based on glider's certified weight range, avoiding complex pilot weigh-ins.
- [ ] 🛠️ The model has been well-received in some competition series (e.g. SRS), where pilots are reportedly happy with the system.
- [ ] 🛠️ Implemented through scoring and logistics, without requiring physical modifications to gliders or changes to race routes.
- [ ] 🚀 Creates market demand for high-performance small gliders.
- [ ] 👥 Encourages more light pilots and women to participate.
- [ ] 👥 Provides another competitive option for pilots who are too light.
- [ ] 👥 Offers a tangible goal for a wider range of pilots, increasing engagement and satisfaction.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 3: Comprehensive Weight Classes (Multi-Winner System)
*(This approach would create multiple weight categories (e.g., every 10kg), with each crowning its own champion. This would potentially replace the single "Overall" winner with multiple champions. As described on [gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/weight-categories).)*

**20. Please rate your overall support for implementing "Comprehensive Weight Classes":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**21. What are your biggest concerns about "Comprehensive Weight Classes"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] ⚖️ Lighter pilots could gain unfair advantages (e.g., in leading points) by flying with heavier gaggles, questioning the legitimacy of their category win.
- [ ] 🏆 Reduces the prestige of a single "Overall" champion title.
- [ ] 🏆 Risks undermining the existing women's category, as female pilots would be split across classes or still incentivized to ballast up for a separate "Overall Women" title.
- [ ] 🏆 Creates small, uncompetitive fields, especially when combined with existing glider classes.
- [ ] 🏆 Having many champions reduces the value of each title.
- [ ] 🏆 Complicates FAI-1 team selection and scoring.

- [ ] 🛠️ Too complicated to manage (e.g., separate starts, scoring, prizes).
- [ ] 🛠️ Requires strict weigh-ins, which are hard to manage and can be cheated (e.g., water loading).
- [ ] 👥 Risks splitting the pilot community into separate groups.
- [ ] Other: __________


**22. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Comprehensive Weight Classes"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] 🛡️ Gives all pilots a class they can fly in with little to no ballast.
- [ ] ⚖️ Pilots only compete against others with a similar all-up weight.
- [ ] 🛠️ Works well in many other sports (e.g., boxing, sailing).
- [ ] 🛠️ Can be based on glider's certified weight range, avoiding complex pilot weigh-ins.
- [ ] 🚀 Creates market demand for high-performance wings across all size categories.
- [ ] 🚀 Specifically creates a protected, competitive market for XXS/XS wings which currently seem to be underdeveloped.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 4: Strict Ballast Limitations
*(A simple rule limiting ballast (e.g., "Max 10kg," or "cannot exceed 15% of body weight"). As described on [gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/weight-checks).)*

**23. Please rate your overall support for implementing "Strict Ballast Limitations":**
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**24. What are your biggest concerns about "Ballast Limitations"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] 🛡️ Doesn't solve the core issue of heavy gear; 28-33kg of equipment is still very heavy and poses a risk.
- [ ] 🛡️ Encourages unsafe and unethical behavior like unhealthy dieting, water-loading before checks, steroid use, and hiding ballast.
- [ ] ⚖️ Penalizes light pilots who need some ballast just to fly an S-size wing safely, while not affecting heavy pilots.  
- [ ] ⚖️ Doesn't fix the core performance disparity; larger wings will still have an advantage.
- [ ] 🛠️ Difficult to enforce fairly and consistently, leading to random penalties.
- [ ] 🛠️ Creates "grey areas" (what counts as ballast vs. gear?).
- [ ] 👥 May push lighter pilots who feel unfairly handicapped out of top-level competition.
- [ ] Other: __________  

**25. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "Ballast Limitations"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] 🛡️ Puts a hard stop on the most dangerous ballast loads.
- [ ] 🛠️ Easy to understand (if not to enforce).  
- [ ] 🚀 May encourage some pilots to move to a smaller wing.  
- [ ] 👥 May encourage top lightweight pilots who have left the sport due to safety concerns to return.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 5: MRT (Multiple Radius Turnpoints)
*(A route-based handicap system where pilots have different turnpoint radii based on their all-up weight. Heavier pilots fly a longer route, equalizing the task in real-time rather than through post-task scoring adjustments. As described on [gagglereport.org](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/mrt).)*

**26. How familiar are you with the "MRT" proposal?**  
- [ ] Not familiar  
- [ ] Vaguely familiar (heard the name)  
- [ ] Familiar (understand the concept)  
- [ ] Very familiar (seen [Burce Goldsmith's lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pz5mvHPNHuikB4BfBoDI-RbNyrvNfWos/view?usp=drivesdk), read the [GaggleReport document](https://gagglereport.org/ballast/mrt))  

**27. Please rate your overall support for implementing "MRT":**  
- [ ] Strongly Oppose  
- [ ] Oppose  
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info  
- [ ] Support  
- [ ] Strongly Support  

**28. What are your biggest concerns about "MRT"? (Check all that apply)**  
- [ ] 🛡️ Creates unpredictable crossing tracks within gaggles near turnpoints.
- [ ] 🛡️ Doesn't solve the physical problem of dangerous ballast.
- [ ] ⚖️ Scoring becomes "random" depending on group composition and who you fly with.
- [ ] ⚖️ Fairness relies heavily on perfect task design.
- [ ] ⚖️ Fairness can be compromised if a turnpoint is placed in a known thermal, nullifying the advantage for lighter pilots.
- [ ] 🏆 Works best without leading points, a fundamental change.
- [ ] 🏆 It could diminish the prestige of a World or Continental Champion title.
- [ ] 🛠️ Relies on specific task design (e.g., cannot be used on straight-to-goal tasks, or in the first/last 10km of a race) and requires specially trained task setters.
- [ ] 🛠️ Route-generation formula is opaque and hard for pilots to understand.
- [ ] 👥 Hard to assess your position and make tactical decisions.
- [ ] 👥 Undermines the key skill of effective gaggle flying by disrupting natural group dynamics.
- [ ] 👥 Difficult for viewers to follow when the lead changes constantly.
- [ ] Other: __________  

**29. What do you see as the biggest benefits of "MRT"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] 🛡️ Directly compensates for wing size performance, discouraging the use of large amounts of ballast.
- [ ] ⚖️ Makes performance more equal across different pilot weights.
- [ ] ⚖️ Gives lighter pilots a realistic chance to be in the lead gaggle and win tasks.
- [ ] 🏆 Allows everyone to race together and preserves a single "Overall" winner.
- [ ] 🏆 Removes the need for controversial leading points, which are seen to favor heavier pilots.
- [ ] 🛠️ Doesn't require adding "equalizers" or new gear.
- [ ] 🛠️ Supported by current scoring software, making it easier to implement.
- [ ] 🚀 May encourage manufacturers to improve other aspects like handling and safety across all wing sizes.
- [ ] 👥 Makes racing more motivating and enjoyable for a wider range of pilots.
- [ ] 👥 Shifts focus from pure gaggle racing to individual pilot skills against the elements.
- [ ] 👥 Can be adapted to help lower-performance classes (e.g., Sport Class) to fly more of the task and be more competitive.
- [ ] Other: __________

### Solution 6: Hybrid System (Single & Multi-Winner Leagues)
*(As proposed by Malin Lobb - creating two parallel competition leagues. Pilots could choose to compete in "Single Winner" events (either "open" or with "Equalizers"/"MRT") feeding a traditional Overall WPRS, OR in "Multi-Winner" events with weight classes and a separate WPRS.)*

**30. Please rate your overall support for implementing this "Hybrid System":**
*(For example, some competitions could be "Open" (status quo), some could use "Equalizers" and some could be "Weight Class" events, with pilots choosing which to attend.)*
- [ ] Strongly Oppose
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Neutral / Need more info
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Strongly Support

**31. What are your biggest concerns about a "Hybrid System"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] 🛡️ The prestigious "Overall" title may still encourage dangerous ballasting in the open league.
- [ ] 🏆 Splits the pilot pool, potentially weakening the quality of both leagues.
- [ ] 🏆 The existence of multiple top-level rankings could devalue the achievement of winning either.
- [ ] 🏆 Events in the "Multi-Winner" league would have fewer participants per category, resulting in lower WPRS points and making them less attractive.
- [ ] 🛠️ Two separate ranking systems would be confusing for pilots and organizers.
- [ ] 🛠️ Requires more overhead for CIVL/FAI to manage two distinct WPRS systems.
- [ ] 🛠️ Competition organizers may be unwilling to manage the complexity of two parallel systems, limiting pilot choice.
- [ ] 👥 Risks splitting the pilot community.
- [ ] 👥 The "Single Winner" league may remain more prestigious, meaning pilots will still carry excessive ballast to compete for the "Overall" title rather than the multi-winner categories.
- [ ] Other: __________

**32. What do you see as the biggest benefits of a "Hybrid System"? (Check all that apply)**
- [ ] 🛡️ Creates a dedicated, safer league for pilots who want to avoid ballast risks.
- [ ] 🏆 Keeps the "Overall" champion concept intact for those who value it.
- [ ] 🚀 Stimulates innovation for different types of gliders.
- [ ] 👥 Offers pilots the freedom to choose the competition format that suits them best.
- [ ] 👥 Allows pilots who feel strongly about weight fairness to compete in a dedicated league without forcing a single solution on everyone.
- [ ] 👥 Lets the community decide over time which format is more popular and successful.
