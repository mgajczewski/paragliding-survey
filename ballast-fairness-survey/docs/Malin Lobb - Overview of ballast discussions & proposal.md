# OVERVIEW

It’s been interesting over the last month, with the different meetings, looking at the chat
group and seeing the pros and cons emerge from each idea. I think up until this point,
it’s been about choosing a single idea. Now, for me, I’m starting to think that the best
option might be incorporating several of the ideas.

It’s very clear that we do have a ballast problem, which is creating a safety issue, and
people feel passionate about it. It’s also clear to me that no one option is perfect, as
each will still affect some people in some way.

This isn’t necessarily “my proposal” — it’s more of a brain dump, a way of getting my
thoughts out and creating a basis for discussion, which can then form a proposal.

The two things I’m focusing on are **happiness** and **safety**. We must be able to include,
and make happy, the most pilots we can, competitions are just a game that we chose to
play.

We have a wide range of pilots who take part in cross-country competitions. We have
the pilots who use it like an organised holiday — so they can go cross-country and get a
retrieve. We have pilots who do one or two competitions a year just to fly with their
friends and have a beer at the end of the day. We have those who are now excited about
the sports class. And we have the elite — the world-class pilots.

We need some sort of structure that can include that wide spread of pilots —nearly
7,500 pilots.

Now, we’re never going to be able to keep everyone completely happy. There are always
going to be some pros and cons to any suggestion. But I feel like what I’m proposing
below will get us the quickest results with the minimum amount of work, and then time
and pilot participation will decide on the winning formula.

It will give pilots choice. It will give organisers choice. And hopefully, the benefit will be
that it encourages more people to come into competitions — and therefore have more
competitions being organised.

So, my proposal — if we can call it that — my thoughts on the subject that will open a
discussion to form a proposal for CIVL, are set out below:

# SUGGESTIONS

We have an existing current world ranking, and that should stay in place. It could be fed
from two types of competition:

SINGLE WINNER EVENTS

1. An “open” single-winner event — basically our current comp format.


2. An “equalized” single-winner event — which could use MRT or equalizers.

If you choose to go to a single-winner event, you can choose either an open or an
equalized single-winner format. The world ranking points you get from each competition
would go into the current world ranking.

MULTIPLE WINNER EVENTS

Then we create a new weight-category league, or ‘multiple winner events”. It has a
separate world ranking, with separate scoring. Importantly, one does not affect the
other rankings.

A pilot could choose to only ever to do the multiple-winner league, or the single-winner
league — or a combination of both.

I’ll go into more detail about how this could work, to help stimulate discussion for a
proposal.

# THE DETAILS

Now, when it comes to MRT and equalizers — the details of that don’t need to be laid
out here, because the best people for that job are the ones currently pushing those
details forward.

So, I’m just going to propose how the multiple-winner events — i.e. weight categories or
classes — could be implemented.

The first point is that you would register the weight category you’re going to fly in for that
year. That could be an option on the CIVL website. You would have to stick to one weight
category per year.

An option would then need to be added to the scoring software, so organisers could tick
whether the competition is a single-winner event — (open or equalized) — or a multiple-
winner event.

Then, you’d need to create some categories on the CIVL website.

You would click on something like “Weight Class League,” which would then open up a
list of the different weight classes and show the top three pilots in each (like when you
click on “Nations,” it brings up the list of nations), there could be a number in the title of
each displayed weight category that showed the amount of pilots in each league.. You
could then click into each weight class and see the total list of pilots competing within
that class.

Example image below:


It would require some added website pages on the CIVL website.

There would also need to be a tweak to the WPRS formula — and I’ll briefly set that out
below.

# WPRS DETAILS

**Current WPRS Formula**

Points = Pmax × D × Q × N × R

Where:

- Pmax = maximum available points for the competition
- D = difficulty coefficient
- Q = quality of field (based on ranking of pilot’s present)
- N = number of pilots in the comp
- R = pilot’s result (e.g. percentage of the winner’s score)

Adapted Formula for Weight-Category Scoring

Points category = Pmax × D × Q × R × S

Where:

- S = scaling factor based on the number of pilots in the weight category
    (e.g. 1.0 if ≥ 8 pilots, 0.85 if 6–7, 0.70 if 4–5, etc.)


This replaces the total pilot count N with a scaling factor S based only on your weight
category.

**Example 1 — Weight Class With Good Participation**

A pilot competing in the 90–100 kg (Middleweight) category:

- 10 pilots in the weight class → S = 1.
- The pilot finishes 2nd, with a score that is 95% of the winner’s score → R = 0.
- Pmax = 1000
- D = 0.90 (task difficulty)
- Q = 0.85 (quality of the field)

Points category = 1000 × 0.90 × 0.85 × 0.95 × 1.0 = 726.

**Example 2 — Weight Class With Lower Participation**

Same competition, but now the pilot is in the 110+ kg (Heavyweight) category:

- 5 other pilots in the class → 6 total → S = 0.
- Pilot again finishes 2nd, with 95% of the winner’s score → R = 0.
- Points category = 1000 × 0.90 × 0.85 × 0.95 × 0.85 = 617.

**Same Result, Two Different Classes**

| Category                 | Pilots in Class | Scaling S | Result R         | Points Earned                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Middleweight (90–100 kg) | 20              | 1.0       | 0.94 (2nd place) | 1000×0.90×0.85×0.94×1.0=720.9   |
| Heavyweight (110+ kg)    | 6               | 0.85      | 0.94 (2nd place) | 1000×0.90×0.85×0.94×0.85=612.765 |

# CATEGORIES

Now, as for the weight categories: the main point is that no pilot of **any weight** would
need to fly with more than 10 kg of ballast. If competition kits could get down to 15 kg,


that would mean no pilot would ever need to fly with more than 25 kg of total kit, which
is already quite heavy.

The proposed weight categories could be:

- Sub-70 kg → Flyweight
- 70 – 80 kg → Featherweight
- 80 – 90 kg → Lightweight
- 90 – 100 kg → Middleweight
- 100 – 110 kg → Cruiserweight
- 110+ kg → Heavyweight

# WEIGHT-CLASS IDENTIFICATION

I’d propose a standardized sticker or logo on the right-hand wingtip — on both the top
and bottom surfaces. It would be uniform in size and shape and color-coded by weight
category.

Each category would have a specific colour — for example, red, yellow, orange, green,
blue, purple— and that sticker colour would be placed on the wingtip.

If desired, the sticker could incorporate the FAI or CIVL logo, or it could include the max
weight of the category — for example, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, or 110+, or the
manufacturers logo etc. The point being that it was standardised in size and colour and
could easily be seen from a distance.

This would allow organisers on launch to quickly see the size of the wing and the weight
class. They could do spot checks by comparing the sticker against certification panel, or
by asking for the pilot’s name and checking that their declared weight category matches
their sticker.

This system would make it easy to visually identify who you're competing against —
both on launch and in the air — and it would eliminate the need to weigh pilots on
launch.

The punishment for cheating, having a sticker that doesn’t match your certification
panel could be a lifetime ban from that league.

# Category 1 Championships and Team Events

At this stage, this proposal hasn’t yet addressed how the system would work for
Category 1 events — such as the European and World Championships — or for national
team scoring.

One possible approach would be to leave current Category 1 events unchanged. These
could continue as open single-winner events, following the existing format, without
requiring any integration of weight categories or equalizers in the immediate future. The
proposal could be implemented independently of any new World Championships —
giving time to evaluate uptake and results at the Category 2 level first.

If desired later, a separate Multi-Winner World Championships could be proposed.
However, this would put additional financial pressure on NACs. Each NAC could then
decide whether to send a team to the standard Open Worlds, to the Multi-Winner
Worlds, or to both — depending on their resources and strategic priorities.

In terms of how a Multi-Winner Category 1 championship might work, it would likely not
follow a traditional team-scoring model. Instead, it could function more like the
Olympics, where each NAC sends a small delegation, choosing how to distribute them
across weight classes.

Some NACs might enter pilots in multiple weight categories to increase their medal
chances across the board, while others may choose to focus all their entries into a
single weight class to maximise the odds of winning gold in that category.


This could lead to medal outcomes such as one nation earning two golds and a silver
across three different weight classes, while another NAC focuses its effort on a single
gold.

If this were implemented at Category 1 level, it would be about individual medals per
weight class, rather than team points. In this format, team scoring would likely not
apply. Each nation could still “team fly” and help their team mates along, but it would
not get scored as such.

For now, this whole topic needs further discussion — whether a separate weight-
category World Championship should exist, whether the format should eventually
integrate into existing Category 1 events, or whether it should remain a standalone
option only at the Category 2 level.

There is also the separate but related discussion around equalizers and whether they
would ever be used in Category 1 events — a decision that would need its own
dedicated proposal.

Ultimately, Category 1 implementation is not the most pressing issue right now, and the
weight-category proposal could go ahead without needing to address this immediately.
That decision can be made later, based on pilot uptake and NAC feedback.

# PRO’S OF THIS APPROACH

This proposal doesn’t water down the pilot pool. Pilots can still choose to compete in
both leagues. With nearly 7,500 pilots globally and only 120 at any given competition,
there are plenty of pilots to go around. It doesn’t affect the woman’s league, and they
can compete for the world overall, the woman’s overall (just as they do now) and there
weight category, which at the lighter end would be dominated by women (over 90%).

Ballast limits, MRT’s and equalisers could all still be implemented.

It’s easy to implement. Yes, there’s some coding to be done, but the changes are
relatively light and could realistically be in place as early as next year.

A problem I see now is until equalisers are proven no one will change the size of their
glider, it will take a long time in varying conditions with different skill levels to get them
accurate, all the while people will be flying with excess ballast “just in case” the
performance isn’t in fact equal. Also, it is still not something that everyone wants to
adopt.

What I’m proposing doesn’t affect pilots in the way a full “one choice” structural change
would.

Pilots who want to compete exactly as they do now can continue to do so — and still
race with peers who share that preference, and still have one winner.


Meanwhile, pilots who don’t trust equalizers, or heavy pilots who never want to use
them, would have a dedicated space to compete where they can still race and have fun,
either in their own weight categories or single winner “open” events.

Once the weight categories are established, that could drive innovation toward lighter,
more efficient equipment. And as equalizers improve and gain trust, we may see a
natural migration over time — pilots drifting back toward single-winner comps using
equalizers, if those systems prove effective.

The most important principle here comes back to the core reason I was passionate
about forming a pilot union: giving pilots a voice and giving them a choice.

Over the coming years, if this system were implemented, we would likely see a natural
evolution. Pilots might initially shift into weight-based leagues, then move back to
equalized events as confidence grows. It’s possible both leagues stay equally popular.

It’s also possible that one league naturally declines over time, and eventually becomes
redundant. The point is: this approach solves the ballast issue quickly and lets the
community shape the future through participation and preference.

The landscape of our competition scene would evolve. Whichever league gains the
most traction will naturally become the dominant model. Or they may all co-exist, rise
and fall in popularity, and be re-evaluated over time. The market — the pilot community
— will decide what works best.

This solution covers the most pros, eliminates many of the biggest cons, and creates
the best balance — which I believe will lead to the greatest number of happy pilots
across the spectrum.

Finally, it gives competition organisers more choice as well. Not every organiser may
want to carry 120 or 130 physical equalizers to an event, renew and maintain them, and
deal with the logistics. Some may prefer to run open single-winner events, or multiple-
winner events — and this system gives them that flexibility.

# A.I ACTION LIST

Having fed the above into AI it has created the following actions, which gives an
indication about how much work it would be to implement:

**Implementation / Actions List**

1.  **Governance & Rule-Change Framework**
    -   Review the current FAI Sporting Code Section 7E – WPRS documentation.
    -   Draft proposed amendments to Section 7E (and possibly the Common Section) to allow for weight-category leagues and separate WPRS streams.
    -   Submit draft rule changes to CIVL Bureau / Plenary for approval (timeline, call for comments, vote).
    -   Once approved, publish change notices and effective dates in the Sporting Code.
    -   Update Local Regulations templates (via Section 7 I – Guidelines & Templates) to reflect the new weight-category competition format. FAI+

2.  **WPRS & Ranking System Updates**
    -   Identify the software platform used for WPRS and ranking (website at https://civlcomps.org/ – pilot registration, results publication) FAI+
    -   Define new data fields for “Weight Category League” vs “Single-Winner League”.
    -   Add options in competition result entry to indicate whether the event is:
        -   Single-winner open
        -   Single-winner equalised
        -   Multi-winner weight-category event
    -   Adjust database schema to support separate ranking tables/streams (e.g., one for open, one for weight-categories).
    -   Implement the adapted formula for weight-category ranking (scaling factor SSS etc) in the backend.
    -   Create UI/UX changes on the WPRS site:
        -   Homepage section for each weight category (display top three pilots)
        -   Filter by nation → weight league → weight class → show number of pilots in each class

3.  **Competition Software & Organiser Tools**
    -   Ensure the scoring software that organisers use supports the new classification (open vs equalised vs weight-class).
    -   Add competition registration fields for weight-class selection for pilots (pilot declares which class they will register in for the year).
    -   Create competition setup checklist for organisers: event type, league type, weight-classes defined, sticker/logo rules etc.
    -   Provide organiser-guides on how to integrate the new format, including launch checks (sticker verification, weight category compliance).

4.  **Pilot Registration & Annual Declaration**
    -   Add a new module in the CIVL pilot registration system for “Declared Weight Category for the Year”.
    -   Enable pilots to sign up for their selected weight class for the year, you must stick to the same category for the year.

5.  **Website & Digital Communications**
    -   Update CIVL website (and NAC websites) with a dedicated page for the new multiple-winner (weight-category) league, explaining how it works and how to register.
    -   On the WPRS website: add landing page for “Weight Category League”, diagram of categories (sub-70, 70–80, 80–90, 90–100, 100–110, 110+).
    -   Place advertorials in print magazines (e.g. XC Magazine, club newsletters) explaining the new format, the pilot choice, and timeline.

6.  **Sticker/Logo Design, Manufacture & Distribution**
    -   Define graphic specifications for the wingtip sticker/logo: size, shape, location (right-hand wingtip, top & bottom surface), materials (weather-resistant).
    -   Assign colour-coding for each category (e.g. Flyweight – red, Featherweight – yellow, Lightweight – orange, Middleweight – green, Cruiserweight – blue, Heavyweight – purple).
    -   Include category label (e.g. “110+”) or optionally FAI/CIVL logo, or both.
    -   Select manufacturing vendor(s) for production of sticker kits.
    -   Determine distribution method: either event-organiser provision at registration, or via NACs/pilot mail-out.
    -   Create compliance verification process for stickers: event launch staff training, certificate check, penalty for mismatch (e.g. lifetime ban from league).
    -   Publish graphic guidelines and official sticker rollout timeline (e.g. “From 1 Jan next year all events must use stickers”).

7.  **Timeline & Pilot/Competition Transition**
    -   Define timeline for rollout:
        -   T- 6 months: Announcement of changes, pilot registration starts.
        -   T- 4 months: Organiser training begins, competition software updates.
        -   T- 2 months: Sticker production completed, website updates live.
        -   Start of season: New pilot registration opens, new league in effect.

This document was a way to organise my thoughts and stimulate more detailed
discussion on tackling this problem. Please add your thoughts, we are past the opinion
stage, we have quite comprehensive pros and cons, now let’s get into the details of a
proposal and how it could realistically be implemented in a timely manner.

Thank you for your time.
