## Proposed Higher-Level Categories

Based on the detailed points above, we can start grouping them into more generic themes. This can help in analyzing the overall sentiment and priorities of the community.

Here is a first draft of such higher-level categories:

*   **Safety**
    *   *Description*: Concerns or benefits related to pilot safety, equipment certification, and incident liability.
    *   *Examples*: `Improves Safety`, `Safety/Certification`, `Safety/Installation`, `Safety (light pilots ballasting)`, `Safety (incomplete solution)`, `Ineffective on Safety (ballast)`, `Safety (crossing tracks)`, `Improves Safety (reduces ballast)`.

*   **Fairness & Equality**
    *   *Description*: How a solution impacts the level playing field for pilots of different weights.
    *   *Examples*: `Levels the field`, `Maximizes Fairness`, `Unfairness`, `Unfairness (performance gap)`, `Unfairness (doesn't solve disparity)`, `Fairness (addresses performance gap)`, `Task Setter Dependency`, `Levels the playing field`, `Provides tactical equality`, `Randomness`.

*   **Competition Prestige & Tradition**
    *   *Description*: How a solution affects the value, structure, and tradition of competition titles and rankings.
    *   *Examples*: `Keeps "Overall" ranking`, `Dilutes "Overall" Title`, `Devalues Titles`, `Preserves Tradition`, `Changes Scoring (no lead points)`.
