24.10.2025, 12:43 - +351 914 026 612: What would it be like if there was a competition in which pilots flew only wing sizes adjusted to their weight and equipment? In other words, the use of ballast was completely prohibited. And consequently, the classification was based on weight classes. Would that be fairer?
24.10.2025, 12:44 - +420 737 683 261: So I’m currently 85-88kg and I’m flying 125 with 10kgs of lead and 2l of water. The issue for me is that I’m almost near the edge of the M size Enzo and I tend to gain some weight during the season. Also I got the L size very cheap 😅
24.10.2025, 12:44 - +49 1573 4866279: Then I would need to fly a -65/-70 wing, there is no model which is competitive in that size at all
24.10.2025, 12:46 - +852 9475 5772: I don’t think we need to be that extreme to prohibit all ballast, but need to find a way to restrict the amount of ballast and to compensate light pilots for promoting safety

24.10.2025, 12:56 - +351 914 026 612: But that's exactly the point: if pilots couldn't add ballast, then there would be many more pilots flying small wings - the uncompetitive ones. And that could promote more investment in the market and manufacturing brands in search of smaller but more performant and safer equipment.
24.10.2025, 12:57 - +34 656 49 91 05: yes, this is my opinion as well
24.10.2025, 13:04 - +852 9475 5772: It’s very normal because racing is about efficiency and speed. I will also prefer to fly a more efficient wing if I’m the same weight as you. Price is also another factor😀

Are you going to ask them to take off their clothes as well to check if they have lead in their pants (also happend before, so I've heard)?

24.10.2025, 16:21 - +386 68 140 112: I do not buy this argument. With this we are basically saying that we have to sponsor the development (manufacturer r&d) if we wish to have good small wings. IMO it should be the other way around; if development of efficient small wings with good handling is indeed possible the manufacturers should be able to invest into the r&d since market seems to be there.

24.10.2025, 17:45 - +386 40 360 437: I was curious about that and did estiamtion.
I have only looked at women. Based on WPRS 50 best women for October 2025
I asked them or I have seen them carry that ballast or they admitted publicly that they carry that amount.

15 and more kg, most over 20kg.

20 of 50 best women are flying with that ballast. 7 of them are within 10 of best in the world.

How many could fly, but for different reasons are not flying it, or not flying it anymore or not yet - 33 of 50 best. Still 7 of the 10 best.

Yes, it is just estimation.
24.10.2025, 17:48 - +386 40 360 437: Please keep in mind that it is not consecutive 10 or 20. it is 10 or 20 within 50 best.

24.10.2025, 18:21 - +52 55 4877 6537: Hi, I’m Pamela. I weigh 50 kg and fly a M’s Zeno. My all-up weight is around 100 kg, with about 33 kg of ballast plus my gear . I’ve flown this setup in previous seasons and again this year at World Cup level. I’ve never had any accident flying with ballast luckily , and I know exactly what that extra weight means.

For my point of view , ballast allows smaller pilots to fly on more equal terms with heavier ones ,something that doesn’t happen in most sports. It gives us the chance to compete based on skill and decision making rather than body size.

The truth is, pilots will always look for the best performing setup possible. Ballast came naturally from that mindset from competitiveness, not from rules. Everyone here wants to be the best, and that drive is what keeps pushing the sport forward.

I also fully recognize that flying with ballast carries more risk. It’s heavier, faster, and more demanding in take off and landidng, and in a collision, that extra weight can make injuries worse. 
Still, I don’t think banning it addresses the real issue; it only limits lighter pilots. The idea of adding drag as an equalizer feels like a step backward, moving away from performance rather than improving it.

Maybe what would make more sense (at least to me) is to explore weight based categories ,like many of you said before , or a scoring formula that accounts for wing size . That might be a better way to keep both fairness and the competitive spirit that define our competition.
24.10.2025, 18:31 - +386 40 360 437: I agree with Pam about wegith based categories. Greta idea  but I can already the resistance coming.
 With those categories later, maybe we even could drop female category as I strongly think that women are as good as men.

But I do not like that 50kg pilot has to fly with that amount of ballast! Why?! what do we agree that is normal? or necessary?
That should not be so widely accepted.
Why there is no in house small pilots working on developing small sizes? Maybe because we all silently agreed to carry that ballast?
Keep you sponsor happy, don't argue because you will be labeled a complainer etc. etc. etc. 
This topic has so many layers.

24.10.2025, 18:38 - +41 78 870 02 30: As we all see, there’s no simple solution to the weight and ballast issue.
There are many different perspectives, each with valid arguments, and every proposed approach has both advantages and disadvantages.

But perhaps we should stop aiming for a perfect fix and instead focus on what is most realistic to implement. Doing nothing isn’t helping anyone.

Could the simplest way forward be to award advantage points based on start weight?
It might not be perfect, but at least it’s a clear and measurable starting point — and a step in the right direction? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>

24.10.2025, 18:47 - +49 1573 4866279: Will be hard to find the balance for a fair factor. There are tasks were through good lines and smart decisions a slower wing can keep up with the main gaggle, but on high speed tasks (even worse in flatlands like Krusevo) when you loose the others because you arrive lower and later at the next thermal you are on your own and screwed.
This would be partially addressed by MRT as it allows keeping the gaggle somewhat together at certain points in the task, but of course creates other problems like "random" turns and strange leading points.

From my perspective Equalisers are the favorable solution as they remove pressure to fly a bigger size for performance and incentivise manufacturers to put more work into small sizes (we would then have to wait for the next gen unfortunately) <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
