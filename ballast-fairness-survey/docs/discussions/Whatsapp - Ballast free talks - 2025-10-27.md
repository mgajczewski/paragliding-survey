27.10.2025, 23:01 - +48 501 500 860: What about the pilots who fly L size gliders because they do not have other choice? I have earned every kg by my own and I carry it every day with me. Girls have their own category (in terms of scoring/class in competition) - big boiz dont (separate weight category? nooo, too complicated probably for scoring, prizes). So, putting funny stuff aside, why do You want to punish guys like me by forcing me to fly with eqalizers on my wing - is this legal modification in terms of certification? will it affect my safety? Will it be part of the certification process to put equalizers during tests (at least up to En-D). Introducing equalizers will punish heavier pilots in benefit of those who choose the wrong sport (no competitive equipment for your weight exists) and do not want to carry enough balast to fly at least M wing (some say the biggest difference exists between xS vs M). I wish I could be an NBA player but i am not tall enough… (massive load of sarcasm in last two sentences, please do not kill me for that…). I fly ballast free so I belong to this group 100% 🙃
27.10.2025, 23:07 - +1 (510) 299-3701: If enough pilots want to look at it that way then weight classes are probably the best approach.
27.10.2025, 23:13 - +1 (510) 299-3701: if you want to tell most of the women they are in the wrong sport I can’t stop you, but I like having them around.
27.10.2025, 23:13 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Well, we will have a Ballast Marathon week to discuss all this.
And weight classes are already implemented in many competitions, so no problem in FAI-2.
The real question is for FAI-1 events.
Without weight classes in the table, we are facing real problems with the concept of FAI-1 Worlds, individual/women/team, team size, etc. I would need some proponent of weight classes to clarify the idea on a FAI-1 Worlds environment.
27.10.2025, 23:14 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Yes, it would be a mess to set up logistically. Which is why I hope most pilots don’t see it that way. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
27.10.2025, 23:16 - +1 (510) 299-3701: If the choice for heavy pilots is between the status quo and equalizers it’s clear they don’t like equalizers. But if the choice is between equalizers and weight classes, they might prefer equalizers.
27.10.2025, 23:18 - +351 918 194 767: that would be an interesting pool.
im a light(ish) pilot (with still a few equalizers) and I rather have equalizers then divided by weight.
27.10.2025, 23:30 - +48 501 500 860: Maybe - on the other hand on some fai-2 comps we have newcomers, junior, fun, sport, serial categories - so maybe it is not as complicated as I thought. Just wanted share my concerns add some opinion from the other side.
27.10.2025, 23:32 - Julien Garcia: By the way, I'm still seeking a commentator for the weight class conférence 🙏🏻
27.10.2025, 23:32 - Julien Garcia: I need someone very convinced
27.10.2025, 23:32 - +1 (510) 299-3701: We have a “Reynolds” class in the US for pilots on gliders up to 95kg top weight. But it’s not worth that much. It doesn’t influence serious competitors to avoid carrying excessive ballast.
27.10.2025, 23:35 - +48 501 500 860: So my central european sarcasm may be too heavy (not for everyone certainly). I know what girls are struggling with - flying small sizes wings which are harder to handle and less performing or breaking their legs and backs with lots of ballast on them.
27.10.2025, 23:38 - Kuba Sto: I hope we'll have a proper teams competitions some day (not the traditional filtering individual results for the teams classification) - and there could be some rules about the total team weight 😁
27.10.2025, 23:43 - +1 (850) 702-1893: Let’s be clear that it is not just girls vs big boiz- some women are larger and some men are small! Especially true of some of our East Asian friends, many of whom are (on average) smaller.
27.10.2025, 23:44 - +1 (850) 702-1893: But is of course true that on average many women have to carry more ballast.
27.10.2025, 23:47 - +1 (850) 702-1893: Regardless, I think the difficult point is that as Josh said we want the sport to be inclusive of smaller competitors. 

I make the point about boiz vs girls so we realize that if we do not provide the smaller people - whether they are girls, small men, Japanese folks, etc - a way to actually compete the sport as a whole loses. 

As Josh said we have a Reynolds class (<95kg) in the US. It’s not very compelling if you want to compete seriously, as in race paragliders with all your friends, regardless of size.
27.10.2025, 23:52 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I think the best argument for weight classes is as a fallback to equalizers. So maybe that case would be an easier one to make - that it’s not the best solution but better than the status quo if we take safety in terms of excess ballast to be important.
27.10.2025, 23:53 - +32 476 28 83 81: also let's not forget within the women classification there is the same big weight disparity so it's also fair to fix that, it's really not about genders here...
27.10.2025, 23:57 - +48 501 500 860: Ok let’s focus on weight I get it. For some it will not be enough to win let’s say 100kg category if there is an open class?
27.10.2025, 23:58 - +48 501 500 860: Going back to equalizers - will they be part of certification process? Who’s flying the L size and have the same question as I    do?
