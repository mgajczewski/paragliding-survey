28.10.2025, 00:13 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Didn’t Ozone pilots test them? CCC doesn’t exclude them AFAIK. 

When discussing this it would be useful to declare our conflicts. I fly an M currently with a generous helping of ballast but it feels OKish.
28.10.2025, 00:15 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Maybe the discussion of whether ballast/fairness are actually problems could be separated from the discussion of how to solve them. Mixing the two can lead to paralysis.

Equalisers don't punish, they just equalise, they reduce an advantage you always had but never earned. About safety, I get your concerns, but what about harnesses? There is no in flight SIV harness certification, yet most of you are happy to fly a Sub which negatively affects safety in abnormal flight. There also have been a bunch of people testing stuff with Equalisers, the Head of the German League put the XL Equalisers on his old X-One (not XL) and flew a full SIV Program on it and also made them avaliable to the rest of the league, but nobody bothered to try for themself <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>

28.10.2025, 07:58 - +386 31 404 688: I think the problems with Equalisers is missed by you all.

The danger is not in the air, flying with them. I have very little doubt that they are reasonably safe attached to a wing. Safer than the cameras you see mounted on helmets or other such stuff. 

The problem with them exists from handing them out at registration and asking 130 points to detach their rear lines, thread them through, then reattach them, replicating the loops they had at the risers. 

Most pilots in CAT1/pwc will do it fine. Some will need assistance.

Asking for these to be used at CAT2.....

But hey, first they need to be tested. Then the issues can be identified and problems considered and addressed. First the principle needs to be validated and feedback from the pilots. Unfortunately the test event back in April was cancelled due to weather. No other organiser has yet come forward to test them.
28.10.2025, 08:08 - +49 1573 4866279: As far as I know there also was a test planned for the Turkey Pwc Trainigs Task, but that got cancelled as well...
I think the issue with remounting lines can be solved by slotting the tubes and figuring out a way to secure them to the riser without opening the maillion, but still needs to make sure they can't be detatched and reattatched while flying.

Also right now Equalisers are only discussed for Cat1 and PWC... so no need to worry about lower level pilots handling them
28.10.2025, 08:34 - Michał Adamczuk: Doesn’t it seem inappropriate to introduce the idea of deliberately degrading the performance of larger wings at this point?
Shouldn’t we first resolve the issue of absurdly dangerous harnesses, such as the submarine-type ones, which were introduced precisely to gain a small performance advantage, before we start reducing the performance of larger wings?

I’ve come across opinions that, for pilots with low body weight, the behavior of the Koyord can, under certain conditions, be significantly worse than for heavier pilots.
But shouldn’t such a fundamental matter as the evolution of harnesses — in a direction that makes them much more dangerous — be our primary concern right now? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
28.10.2025, 08:46 - +48 501 500 860: This will actually include all pilots starting from XS size  (shortest noodles). So all will be equalized down to the worst performing glider. Larger sizes will be punished in weak conditions (not significantly but still, look at the polar), anyway we are talking about single digit centimeters per seconds on both ends.
28.10.2025, 08:47 - +33 6 41 96 06 33: No it’s not inappropriate. These are two separate issues. Equalizers already exist. Changing the safety norms for harnesses will take years.
28.10.2025, 09:16 - +44 7815 693738: Changes to safety norms on harnesses taking years is another problem that needs addressing 😂
28.10.2025, 10:00 - +34 678 72 10 76: I think we sometimes miss the point... whether there are equalizers or weight categories, the key lies in the amount of weight allowed in flight. We need to limit the total weight in flight, rather than talking about ballast. Otherwise, we'll be looking for tricks with heavier equipment to claim it's the equipment that weighs, not the ballast. We already know that flying with too much weight is more dangerous during takeoff, landing, or when you enter a spiral due to inertia. Allowing pilots to assume the risk they consider is like allowing us all to drive as much as we want on the roads (I wish that were true)... or something like that. When smoking was banned in Spain inside restaurants and nightclubs, it seemed like the end of the world... a few years later, we all realized that it was one of the best measures taken, and you can't imagine the controversy that arose when the measure was implemented. We must take action if we truly care about safety, knowing that it's not an easy step, but it will undoubtedly reduce the severity of incidents. Direct proposals are what we need.
28.10.2025, 10:14 - +44 7815 693738: You don’t need to limit the amount of weight in flight if you have equaliser or weight categories as there would be no point in flying with ballast. You could just fly with normal or even lightweight kit.
28.10.2025, 10:48 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: I think it is good to reduce the weight in flight, there was a discussion about this 3 years ago airline related (maximum backpack size, maximum basic equipment weight, with a transition period) but nothing happened.

As for ballast, I fear no solution (equalizer, weight category, etc.) will be effective if ballast limits are not reinstated, as incentives could still be there to ballast up: equalizers do not totally equalize, one can choose his weight category related to his ambitions in the general category.

The only problem is that small pilots ( below 70 kg) will still need to ballast up, at least until suitable CCC gliders exist in their "natural" PTV (all up weight)
28.10.2025, 11:06 - +44 7815 693738: Yes but first the change needs to happen and then the manufacturers would make better wings for that class. At the moment there is no point making nicer XXXS CCC wings as no one buys them, if they were a real market for them then it would be worth it. It will never happen the other way around.
28.10.2025, 11:09 - +49 1573 4866279: the airline max weight thing is included in the new civl harness spec. 10kg max harness weight and maximum dimensions with reserves installed

28.10.2025, 20:19 - +41 76 465 96 05: In cross-country flying, most top-ranked pilots are small and use a lot of ballast — this has always been the case. Andy Aebi was flying with a slab of lead instead of a protector in his harness :-) The combination of a smaller body (less drag) and higher wing loading provides a clear advantage, especially in gaggles where climb performance and gaggle control matter most, and also in challenging conditions with weak and narrow thermals. Heavy pilots may have a clear advantage in strong conditions during full-on racing, but this is not where most competitions are decided. Therefore, any discussion about competition “equalizers” should also include stricter ballast regulations.
28.10.2025, 20:22 - +1 (850) 702-1893: Sorry, this isn’t reality. The smaller wings just don’t glide as well or as fast. Most high level races are full on all the time. So it’s a full time disadvantage to be on a smaller wing. 

Wing loading matters, of course. 

Ask me how I know - I’ve flown various sizes and there’s a reason I suffer ballast. Because I want to actually compete. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
28.10.2025, 20:26 - +386 31 404 688: I think you two are approaching from different angles and ~L's point was misunderstood.

The best combination is a small harness (ie remove thick foam and add thin lead) and a big glider. Lowest drag, best Reynolds.

Hence,,, smaller pilots ballast up to fly bigger wings.
28.10.2025, 20:31 - +351 967 044 588: Yes the most aerodinamic results with come from a smaller pilot on a larger wing. A bigger body /harness will always create more drag
28.10.2025, 20:34 - +49 1522 2444190: True point. It's not the big guys with xl gliders winning comps. It's the small guys with the m size wings and a lot of ballast <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
28.10.2025, 20:34 - +49 1573 4866279: There is this Ted Talk by Heli Eichholzer about this: https://youtu.be/_AqvyXSRjDQ (German only unfortunately, maybe auto subtitles are useable) 
Now imagine going with such a modified Harness to a comp nowadays...

(Also as far as I understand the circumference (=frontal area) of the Submarine is the same for all sizes as they use the same inner structure)
28.10.2025, 20:37 - +351 967 044 588: If you look at the equalizers the objective its just to get more area exposed to increase drag, so lets imagine a pilot with 60kg with their arms exposed and a pilot with 90kg with their arms exposed, dont you think their arms thickness diference will represent more drag than the equalizers? :)
28.10.2025, 20:38 - +49 1573 4866279: Read the Document by Luc, he already is taking harness and arm size into account
28.10.2025, 20:38 - +386 31 404 688: No. Frontal area changes. The Sub harnesses are scaled, including frontal area.

Then you would have a scaled head and arms too, which also form part of the frontal area.
28.10.2025, 20:40 - +351 967 044 588: interesting, will give it a read again
28.10.2025, 20:40 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: It is the talented guys who win comps, but flying a size that does not penalize them much.
PWC and FAI-1 Champions have been of different weight along the years. We had heavy guys and light guys.
The fact that today some of the top pilots are small is coincidental.

The question here is: are designers wrong about their calculations of weight advantage ? Are Luc and Bruce wrong ? Is there anybody else developing a mathematical explanation of why it is better to be small ?

28.10.2025, 20:42 - +41 76 465 96 05: Violetta, I don’t doubt your points — smaller wings, let’s not forget, are also more difficult to handle because they have less inertia and react more nervously in turbulent air. But I’m quite sure that most top pilots (and also many designers and test pilots) have been flying M-size wings with a lot of ballast, and overall this combination represents the current performance benchmark. If these pilots were flying S-size wings instead, we would all benefit, because the development focus would naturally shift toward that size range. It’s a different situation for pilots below S size — I can’t really judge their perspective, but I have a lot of sympathy for it.
28.10.2025, 20:43 - +49 1573 4866279: I think Eduardo has a point, it's not People on M wings winning because M performs the best but because they live an active lifestyle and that also plays into mental performance while flying. There are also a few XL pilots who manage to do this (Somi, Ferdi...) but statistics have most people on XL wings living an not ideal lifestyle😬
28.10.2025, 20:44 - +852 9475 5772: I guess it’s quite difficult to compare as different pilots have different body builds, making it, for example, a tall, skinny 90 kg pilot vs a shorter, big belly 90 kg pilot.

28.10.2025, 21:36 - +41 76 465 96 05: No, it’s true and probably undisputed. But there’s also an advantage for smaller wings in weak thermals and in gaggle control, which wasn’t mentioned — and it’s quite significant in many situations. 

Anyway, my point was simply that any equalizer system should go hand in hand with more restrictive ballast rules, at least for pilots flying sizes from S to XL. This aspect is currently missing in Luc’s proposal. (Probably all the Ozone guys — except Russ — are true S-pilots ;-)
28.10.2025, 21:40 - Mateusz Gajczewski: advantage for smaller wings in weak thermals and in gaggle control?
it's where smaller wings suck the most 😆
28.10.2025, 21:45 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: I agree with you that in order to be an effective system for the ballast problem, maximum ballast+equipment limits have to be reinstated, to avoid overballasting when unnecessary (leaving very small pilots aside for a while to cope with the lack of suitable XS and XXS gliders, until those gliders become available)
28.10.2025, 21:52 - +386 31 404 688: Keep in mind one of the strong reasons why equipment limits were removed though. A solution would need to be considered for the practicalities of an organiser if the limits were brought back. 

Specifically, if it was a 33kg limit on kit the method used was to weight the pilot at registration and thereafter in the week, the pilot and kit should be within 33kg.

But the way around it was to drink 5 litres of water before going into registration (which is dangerous) or to wear lead knickers. No self respecting organiser is going to ask to inspect a pilots knickers. 

Any rule must be enforceable, or it is meaningless.
28.10.2025, 21:56 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: You can make "surprise" weight controls at TO or at Goal (if you can level a scale there 😁) and if you find a pilot with more than 4 kgs ? difference from the registration day, he gets disqualified ? 
Just an idea out of the box right now <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
28.10.2025, 21:58 - +386 31 404 688: I am supportive of the measures. It is just a point to say, ensure rules are easily enforceable. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
28.10.2025, 21:59 - +386 31 404 688: Cloud flying is a classic example of an unenforceable rule, sadly.
28.10.2025, 22:04 - +48 501 500 860: He takes into account an „average pilots arms” and physique. So being a smaller pilot with the larger wing is still an incentive to keep a lot of ballast less drag overall than the bigger size pilot with zero ballast (both using equalizers)
28.10.2025, 22:06 - +386 40 360 437: stop using letters and start using numbers. 85kg, 95kg, 90 kg?

the gliders you have mentioned are not available because there are no pilots willing to fly them (they all ballsating up to size or two sizes bigger). So the gilder will not be available in the future as in the manufacturers' minds there is no market.
It doesn't not matter that the marek do exist if it is hidden under the ballast.
 The manufactueres do not seems to be ready to make those gliders anyway by not having the pilots willing to test them for them.
And the circle begins ....
28.10.2025, 22:10 - Krzysztof Maciejczuk: I think some people want to change physic law by rules. Smaller gliders always will have worse behaviour and gliding parameters.
28.10.2025, 22:20 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Well Luc is proposing the equalizers, so we must assume at least Ozone will put some effort in making those gliders available. We can ask Luc about that in the presentation he gives
28.10.2025, 22:21 - +41 78 870 02 30: I haven’t heard any arguments that would stick against weight ranges, it would be certainly more practical than any other measures discussed here.
28.10.2025, 22:22 - +48 501 500 860: 1. Equalizers are applied using weight ranges declared by the manufacturers - this can be easily manipulated on the edge of limit (max rounded weight by 2.5kg) everyone will take this into account in their next gen (prove me wrong) - just to have a bit smaller equalizer for the range
2. Manufacturers will be magically motivated to improve smaller gliders performance (also handling or just performance) says Luc - kind of understandable but will it make them fly better than „equalized” bigger sizes? Equalizers should be adjusted then?
28.10.2025, 22:23 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: I bet all these questions are for Luc, that is part of the idea of the presentations
28.10.2025, 22:41 - +48 501 500 860: So You say You have never measured Pal 19mm safe trim of his wing? Is it enforceable in field conditions during competition? (hope it is not too sarcastic)
28.10.2025, 22:45 - Krzysztof Maciejczuk: Name that mythical creature who drank 5l of water just before registration. Was it a camel? Goosh i love this nonsence arguments lays in all this discussions :D
28.10.2025, 23:01 - +386 31 404 688: Actually, we do measure wings in our events. We took several wings from competitors and measured them for compliance. Usually you get a thank you for a free trim check 😅
28.10.2025, 23:12 - +1 (850) 702-1893: Again, it’s just not true that smaller wings have an advantage in weak thermals and with gaggle control. Let’s not mythologize it.

Smaller wings can theoretically turn tighter, but that doesn’t make much of a difference in gaggle flying. 

How you trim your wing and whether you choose to fly light or heavy does of course affect whether you will be more floaty or more fast.
28.10.2025, 23:14 - +1 (850) 702-1893: As to ballast limits and weigh ins - people didn’t like them in the first place, did try to cheat by drinking water, putting weights in their shoes, etc. People hated those restrictions. (I was not around for them, but this is what I’ve been told.)
28.10.2025, 23:23 - +1 (850) 702-1893: Again, I’m someone whose competition experience is extremely affected by ballast. I’d prefer to carry less, but I can’t really get behind a solution that makes it less possible for me to participate fully in the competition, even if it makes it safer and less annoying for me. So because I want to be on the same playing field I accept the annoyance and the danger. 

Equalizers have the theoretical advantage of leveling the playing field but not reducing pilot choice. They’re worth a try. 

Weight limits/weigh ins don’t. They would put smaller people in a place where essentially we have to accept not being competitive at the same level as larger people. I’m not sure I personally would be interested in competing that way; others surely would still want to try.

Practicalities aside, I can’t get behind something that would push myself and others out of the sport.
28.10.2025, 23:48 - Krzysztof Maciejczuk: Fully understandable, but there are other sports fully affected by competitors weight, eg olympic sailing class laser/ilca sailing. Sad but true. I think we cant find perfect solution, only slightly better. About weight classes do we have enough competitors to divide? Not so long ago there were ppg competitions with very few, eg 4 in category 😁 I this case i preffer equalisers also
