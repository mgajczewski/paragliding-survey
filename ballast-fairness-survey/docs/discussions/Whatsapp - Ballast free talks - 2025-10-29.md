29.10.2025, 00:01 - +386 31 404 688: See the SRS results for some breakdown of weight classes.
29.10.2025, 04:58 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I remember, along with some others treating it as a challenge to show up heavy for weigh in. You can make up a fair bit of weight with creatine, water, heavy clothes and shoes. Not exactly cheating but kind of silly.
29.10.2025, 05:45 - +49 1573 4866279: Read the Document again. There Luc clearly states the current proposed equaliser lengths are already calculated for this theoretical next gen of wings with optimised line thicknesses and load tests for every size
29.10.2025, 05:58 - Sopot - Meet Director: The simplest solution will be to create a title for the pilots on small wings (max 95 kg). It will give them the option to carry less ballast, buy saller wing and be competitive (in their category of course) for the podium.
29.10.2025, 06:47 - +1 (510) 299-3701: As mentioned before we already have that subcategory in the US. It's not attracting anyone who wasn't already flying that size. And it doesn't address the 70kg pilots ballasting to 115 with 45 kg of gear.
29.10.2025, 06:48 - Sopot - Meet Director: World title may attract more people ...
29.10.2025, 06:54 - +49 1573 4866279: Are there other light pilots in this group who have experience flying the XS and XXS (-95kg and smaller) sizes of current CCC wings?
I feel like they have a very bad reputation and almost all pilots who could fly them choose to go to S (-105) instead not only because of performance but also flying comfort.

(I'm 54kg and stepped up to a X-One 20 during this year, so far I feel like it's manageable but have no comparison to other models or sizes) <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
29.10.2025, 06:54 - +49 1522 2444190: The nice Thing about Equalizers is it's a relatively simple thing to try.  But, it won't change anything for the really light pilots.  Maybe there are some s pilots ballasting up to m going back to s, but i am sure it only will be a few. 

For sure nobody will buy a xs enzo just because we have noodles now. 

And why would there be suddenly new wonder xs wings with better performance and safety. It's still just very little pilot numbers. 

Remember,  with introduction of ccc manufacturers were forced to produce a small size. The idea was the same.  Turned out the wings were shitty. Some really good sure superlight pilots (Nicole, Seiko ) tried them and went on for the bigger size. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
29.10.2025, 07:04 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Why are you so sure it would only be a few? I am one of them and would seriously consider it.

Of course it would be more attractive in a context where the S is competitive and designers put more work into it. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
29.10.2025, 07:16 - +49 1522 2444190: Because many of the pilots i talked to fly the m enzo not just for performance reasons but for comfort aswell. 

Plus I wouldn't buy a new wing and then find out 10cm noodle difference doesn't change anything and I fly a season on a wing I think I have no chance with. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
29.10.2025, 07:17 - +1 (510) 299-3701: That's always the risk when a new glider comes out if you're an early adopter. You can of course wait and see a little.
29.10.2025, 07:18 - +39 339 604 2016: And because not only of true performance. Floating in moving air M is much better that S! <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
29.10.2025, 08:32 - +386 40 360 437: yes, maybe, but you are ballasting up to one size bigger gldier not two sizes bigger. You are not 50 to 60kg pilot with kit of 45 to 50kg. Can you see the difference?.
And also yes, there are more than few pilots.
Why do you think Seiko and Nicole are not in the competitive sport anymore? Because they got bored? No becouse how long you can play that game. Why would they step down to a smaller size after winning for sow long bigger one and winning. When the next women is twice their size physically and will have to do nothing apart form just fly?
They just left the competitive sport.
And they are not the only onse.
For some long I was trying not to use any names or manufacturers.
Would they come back to fly Xone 95kg as there are pilots flying thsi size, also there is at least one coming back and forth from 105 to 95 to 105 and 95kg.

maybe that's a revelation for some - Yes, there are more pilots struggling with 15 and more kg pure ballast (men as well, wake up).
Why people fighting so hard to not to chage that ballast? Are they stuck to thinking that they can beat those two women/men who are by nature heavier then them and don't have to do anytihng to fly those 115kg gliders almost on the top?. Maybe start thinking that if Hono, Baptist and Seb fly the 105kg as they perfectly can, maybe then those pilots would beat them?
No? are you sure, not? So it is not only about ballast but something more? Or you would give it a go if they be in the more normal category?
Yes, that would affect everybody, so nobody would have to be soo worried not winning or not having chance to win, that season.

And very quick reality check for all of us.
There is way more men than women ballasting up to 115kg and thinking that they may have a chance of beating those best of the best which also ballasting up to 115kg. How big those chances are, when you all look at the past 5, 10 years? Be honest with yourself. Did that stop you from flying all those comeptitions ? No?
I'm assuming would not stop you. What if I tell you you can now stop carrying that much ballast, and try again? You would not try? Come on.
They are beating all those bigger guys becouse they are better on "plainish" field of men sizes, not because of the size their gliders. Not only for sure. 

If we all step lower why do we think anything would change? You are compering yourslef to or the best of the best or to physically heavier person who yes will beat you on the final glide due to that minimal speed or hight they have. Is that what is really stopping you then to compete? Only that?
It is nit only removing the biggest ballast (we have to be realistic, some ballast has to be used), but changing how we score the comeptitions. Why overall means so mich if there are 4 wegith categories?

And yes, the obvious thing PARAGLIDERS.
Do the lighter pilots have to fly ccc? if they already proved to be more handful and not performing that well, while en-d with recent years design are perfectly able to keep up with with ccc.

We all are here so focused on ourselves and what we may loose, not thinking about what others, also new coming pilots, may gain and sport overall including US here.
We like personal example, right, here you have mine. 
My en-d is 90kg im flying it 87kg, seems to be sweet spot. Last year I could beat on it beat the women who are my size or lighter ballasting up to fly 100kg size of the same glider and also 105kg ccc (ballasted 98-99kg). I still consider myslef upcoming pilot, still getting better, still not consistent enough. When, yes when (we all believe in ourselves, we shoudl give ourselves right to do so) I level my skills and reach my best, I'll much Constance skills (currently 1st female WPRS) will I be able to beat her in overall ranking assuming. I seriously think, I won't. Why? Im not going to fly 105kg gldier again. Decided.
 After a try in 2 comeptitions to fly with 23kg ballast, and one of them beeing a disaster in terms of safety on the gorund, in the air, worse than some club comeptitions  I've decided not to do it again. No trophy is worth it. Will I stop flying Noooo. I love it. I cannot beat bigger pilots, true, but I can still prove I'm better pilot than them, I can try. No WPRS will show it, but I will be there on the top.

Having weight classes, similar like in Marathons they have age classes (just less) will keep me motivated.

Manufactures working on gliders - would keep me motivated. The market is THERE/HERE hidden by the ballast.

Maybe ccc design below 105kg is inherently wrong? Or after have been forcefully invented for certification have not been developed since?! 
By who also ask yourselves. Where are those light (50, 60, 70kg) pilots who can test the performance and handling to keep the similar feeling?

Maybe the anwser is en-d for lighter pilots, weight classes, and ballast limit combined (!).COMBINED 

And yes, yes, we are keeping the overalls, but just to know. Everyone wants to know. 😊

Noodles seemed to be good idea, but I would like to see the top pilots dropping their ballast... I dont think they will if they have that feeling they may lose a season. And the noodles are not helping light pilots, they still have to fly the same gliders  so they are stuck with 100kg en-d, 105kg ccc. They will not on their will drop to a smaller ccc or en-d.
29.10.2025, 10:52 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Today we have the Luc presentation of equalizers.
It would be CRITICALLY IMPORTANT to have a couple of light and a couple of heavy pilots, with extensive high level competition experience, to ask the relevant questions and to challenge the idea the best possible.
29.10.2025, 11:00 - +34 656 49 91 05: I’ll share my vision here again (although we have it on the gaggle report theme discussion).

I believe we are discussing about “patches” instead of a general solution. I know that my proposal is too heavy to be applied now, it will have many oppositors, but I think is the proper solution for the future: real weight classes.
Like any other sport, differentiate the competitions by weight. We have been discussing, it would be needed 4-5 classes to avoid the over-ballasting within the class.
my proposal would be (when possible):
- 2 separate starts by grouping classes. f.e. 3 lighter & 2 heavier (or however distribution the Organizer wants according to participants)
- ⁠2nd lighter group will have a separate start point 15 mins later
- ⁠security advantages: avoid collisions on start, queues on take-off
- ⁠separate leading points like if there were 2 different competitions. Real strategic diffrence between the 2 groups.
- ⁠the rest of the task will be the same
- ⁠advantages about weights and ballast: pilots will have a real motivation to fly on its proper weight class, and will be competing with their equals. (weight categories will be split by 10kgs, so it shouldn’t be a big ballast problem here to jump between class)
- ⁠Also we could increase participants, as there will be less risk in the start point.. f.e. maybe 2 groups of 80? 160 participants.
- ⁠disadvantage: overall winner will dissapear, only will be weight class winner. But it is like that on every other sport.
29.10.2025, 12:34 - +41 78 870 02 30: Would someone please share the link to the meeting tonight with Luc
29.10.2025, 12:40 - Julien Garcia: I do it on général in 10 min
29.10.2025, 12:45 - +49 179 4847989: <Pominięto multimedia>
29.10.2025, 12:45 - Julien Garcia: CET good catch
29.10.2025, 13:00 - +44 7815 693738: I agree with you, but I think that is a bit overly complicated. Ideally it needs 6 weight categories or some people will still have to carry a lot of ballast which would defeat the point. I think, the categories below would mean that no one would have to fly with more than 20kg above their weight to be competitive in their class. (Maybe if you are 45kg naked you might need 22-23kg)

Something like this:
- Sub 70 - flyweight
- 70-80 - featherweight
- 80-90 - lightweight
- 90-100 - middleweight
- 100-110 - cruiserweight
- 110 plus - heavyweight 

That being said, all of this needs some numbers as to pilots naked weight in our community to know how many fall in to those categories. Until then it’s hard to say what’s needed. Anyone got any data?! I think for this debate we desperately need it! 

With 20 pilots in each category that would still only be 120 pilots so you could all start at the same time. If one category didn’t fill you could go around and allocate one more place to the other categories until the comp was full. You could need a minimum of 3 in any category for it to be a valid category. 

As you could be scored against your own size, it would be 6 races in one, and lead out points would be in relation to other pilots in your weight class. The person at the “front” of your race might not be at the front of “the” race but would be getting the max lead out points for your category. I know they are not taking as much risk as the person at the front but they are still out-flying everyone else in their category.

As, like you say, this idea gets rid of an overall winner there could be an extra “gift” that the overall winner could get (because he would be the winner of their weight class as well they could receive it at the same time), like the yellow tee-shirts in the Tour de France (but not a tee-shirt, we have enough of them in our sport 😂), a bottle of champagne would be better! A little nod of respect for coming “first” even though the comp wouldn’t be scored as a whole. You listed this as a disadvantage, I just think it’s different to what we are used to. 

I’m sure comp gear could get down to 15kg with harness, two reserves and comp wing and still be robust. The harnesses could be made a bit lighter with a few tweaks in materials, 12mm webbing, carbon fibre seat plate etc. That would be the dream (my dream at least) proper back protection, and 15kg kit with no ballast. 

As for little wings not being nice to fly, I’m sure when there is a market for them then more R&D will be put in to it. The Asian market is growing massively and a lot of them are light, and I think we would be surprised about how many pilots in our community could fly in the smaller categories. The small wings will only have to be competitive against themselves as well so they won’t have to be tweaked to the maximum to try and be as good as the bigger sizes, they can be made to be nice to fly,  albeit with potentially less performance than a bigger size but it wouldn’t matter as you wouldn’t be scored against other sizes. 

As for CAT1’s, each countries selection could stay the same as it is now. So you send your best pilots, but they might all be competing in the same weight category, does that matter? Or if each nation sent one pilot for each category then you would have to stagger the start because there would be over 300 pilots! 

These are just my initial thoughts on the subject, I’m not precious about any of them and welcome a debate on the finer details.

It is what a confusing title to that section. Even as an English speaker, I thought it was a coding error and a repeat of the kettle section. It English, I would say Hat, not Cap. But maybe better still would be ' How do you wish your voice to be heard' or something like that. Just as a suggestion

29.10.2025, 15:04 - +41 78 870 02 30: Isn't it more practical to use takeoff weight? I mean for audits/probes and registration? Afterall one of the benfit of weight classes is that we could allow whatever balast and whichever wing somone would want to fly as long as they fit in the category.
29.10.2025, 15:09 - +34 656 49 91 05: for me it is.. Wing Max load homologated
29.10.2025, 15:11 - +34 656 49 91 05: like that you don’t have to weight anyone, just check the wing label if you have doubts.. no one will cheat there 😁
29.10.2025, 15:12 - +44 7815 693738: Yes 👍
29.10.2025, 15:12 - +44 7815 693738: Well this actually.
29.10.2025, 15:13 - +44 7815 693738: Exactly, simple. In fact manufacturers could put the size of the wing on the tip so it would be clear to see for everyone.

29.10.2025, 16:56 - +41 78 870 02 30: At the moment, the titles are unfair and encourage unnecessary risk-taking.
Weight classes do not “dilute the titles” — they make them fair and our sport safer.

The days when only 40 pilots showed up for a competition are long gone. In the venues and events we are discussing, we now have a large and diverse community. Our elected organizational bodies have a duty to adapt and evolve to represent and protect all pilots — not just those in a specific weight range.

Many pilots have already stopped competing because they either cannot or simply do not want to carry large amounts of ballast in order to fly an Mor L size Enzo — and to accept all the associated risks that come with it.

Concerns about organization and logistics are valid, but they are certainly easier to solve transparently and correctly than the current system by equalizers or MRT adjustments, which are complex, opaque, and leave too many variables unresolved.

How do “equalizers” help an XS Enzo pilot who faces a proven 25% disadvantage in turbulence (as supported by studies)? You simply cannot calculate or compensate for such differences. Flying an L or M-size Enzo compared to an XS or XXS is fundamentally and unavoidably unfair — and no “noodles” or MRT formula can fix that.

Now imagine if we could simply define clear weight classes and let pilots fly the equipment and weight of their choice.
We would preserve the freedom of choice, respect individual experience, and still benefit from all the investment and evolution we’ve made in scoring and competition systems.

No one would be forced to change their glider, ballast setup, or flying style.

This approach would make competitions fairer, safer, and more inclusive, without undoing years of progress in technology and scoring. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>

29.10.2025, 17:35 - +32 476 28 83 81: fair points but isn't the goal to actually go towards as little ballast as possible for safety reasons ? rather than find a way to keep the status quo of "No one would be forced to change their ballast setup" as you mentioned ?
29.10.2025, 17:36 - +386 31 404 688: Haha. I just reread what I wrote. Autocorrect is terrible.
29.10.2025, 17:41 - +41 78 870 02 30: @⁨~Alexandre⁩ if you could fly your weight category and win it why would you ballast up in other category? You see the point? 
And
We will have much more traction and progress by giving eachother the freedom to choose, maybe someone is happy with 20k balast and is an athlete that can carry it like nothing and is used to dynamics of an L Enzo, why should we judge and force him to fly anything else?
At the moment it is the opposite we force anyone that wants to have a chance to compete to ballast up, this is BS! <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
29.10.2025, 17:58 - +32 476 28 83 81: Definitely forcing to ballast up is no good, but maybe some reasonable limit should also exist, like max 25% of total weight or whatever, as it's also a goal to promote more security, and even if you can handle it, being 60kg with 25kg of ballast (40%) is clearly less safe.
29.10.2025, 18:06 - +41 77 262 84 99: I have nothing against reasonable limits but remember these kind of limits has to be decided by somone and these decisions alienate people most and hard to agree upon, specially our current top 50. I know a few that exceed that 40% mark for example.
29.10.2025, 18:10 - +48 604 543 170: And being 50kg with 35kg of gear is clearly even less safe, but please find me a glider that flies reasonably on less than 90kg
