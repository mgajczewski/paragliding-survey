30.10.2025, 00:44 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I got more like .07N and .15N respectively
30.10.2025, 04:28 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: between two sizes (100kg vs 110kg), I got about 2N (200g) equalizer drag differential at full speed.
30.10.2025, 04:34 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: It does not really matter if it's more or less than other differences in the performance equation (harness differences, glide age differences, glider brand differences, etc.). These other differences are not related to the ballast issue. They are other subjects. @igor: it does not matter how small size differences are, they are big enough for pilots to decide to ballast up.
30.10.2025, 04:40 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: There is something (amongst other) that I forgot to mention in my presentation but that is crucial: Size Equalizers is a compensation that does not interfere with the performance related to gaggle flying. I'm on the same line as Bruce on many of the points regarding size desadvantage (and thanks for this work and presentation), however I fear MRT is interfering too much into gaggle flying aspect of the performance to a point where the compensation becomes very random. @⁨~François Cormier⁩ mentionned it during Bruce's presentation, but let me give a simple but realistic exemple: <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 04:45 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: A group has formed from the start and is made of 9 Small pilots + 1 Medium pilot.  The Medium cannot pull out of this group because his size advantage is not enough compared to the group effect on performance.  After passing the MRTurnpoint, the Medium glider is left behind the group of 9 Small pilots. The extra performance given by the group is much higher than the size performance difference. The Medium pilot is then left away. The compensation is effectively unfair because it did not take into acount how the group dynamic affect the effective performance. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 04:47 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: You could adjust the MRT dials as much as you want to compensate for that particular group case. It will become unfair for some other scenarios (1 Small + 9 Medium, etc.) <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 04:51 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: I understand that MRT can be fun for low level competition, but when it comes to Cat1, we need high level of fairness with lowest level of randomness. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 05:00 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Bruce: you said we should race against nature more than against the other. But what current high level pilots like is to race against each others, or race together against nature (and that's the main reason why Elasped Time type of race is so unpopular in PG competitions). <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>

30.10.2025, 09:19 - +39 339 604 2016: Hi everyone, from my perspective it's truly paradoxical that at the top parsgliding level we try to optimize everything, constantly trimming our gliders, trying to create as little drag as possible, and then we end up with these noodles hanging from our lines. Especially since there will always be advantages and disadvantages to certain glider sizes. Particularly when you're between sizes, you have to make a decision. We're talking about high-level competitions here. I find it incomprehensible. 🤔
30.10.2025, 09:22 - +39 339 604 2016: Perhaps manufacturers should offer two or three more sizes; that would make more sense.
30.10.2025, 09:27 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Paradix only comes because you mix up subjects here, Joachim. Even if we were flying school wings, we would have to deal with the ballast issue.
30.10.2025, 09:31 - +48 501 500 860: Ta wiadomość została usunięta
30.10.2025, 09:32 - +39 339 604 2016: All top pilots try to be as professional as possible and pay attention to every little detail to optimize the overall performance. The performance difference between gliders in the past was much, much greater. It's absurd that I try to trim the glider, wear a small helmet, and avoid flapping sleeves, and then I have to tuck these noodles in. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 09:33 - +39 339 604 2016: For ecample i am too heavy for S size and not perfect for M size. So i have to ballast ca. 8 kg.
30.10.2025, 09:34 - +39 339 604 2016: The only Subject for me is to optimize everything in a perfect way. Material, skills, mental part.
30.10.2025, 09:34 - +39 339 604 2016: I have the feeling that we have to hear more toppilots here!
30.10.2025, 09:37 - +39 339 604 2016: And we don't resolve the problem of the superlight pilots. They have still to carry ballast to go for a S size!
30.10.2025, 09:38 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Top pilots from all weights range 😉
30.10.2025, 09:38 - +39 339 604 2016: Shure!
30.10.2025, 09:38 - +49 1573 4866279: Well, if Luc's Plan plays out we would only have to ballast up to an XXS size with the next gen of wings
30.10.2025, 09:39 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: But Joachim, you'll still have to optimize things the same way if you want to win. Winning is about relative performance, not absolute.
30.10.2025, 09:40 - +351 914 026 612: Thank you very much. 👏
30.10.2025, 09:40 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: otherwise how can you keep motivation to fly paragliders when sailplane are so much more performant !?
30.10.2025, 09:41 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: The problem here is that I have the feeling all the light pilots see the issue and the advantage of making somethings in a direction that is for exemple equalisers (and I’m in this range of pilots and in favour of testing the equalisers), middle weight pilots don’t really see a clear issue and heavier pilots are horrified by this idea because they don’t want to glide less than today
30.10.2025, 09:42 - +39 339 604 2016: I flew some comps with Heli Eichholzer. The performance in pure gliding from his S size is good compare to the M. As soon we enter in termal or in moving air he is lost!! And i am not shure that M size pilots will go down on S size.
30.10.2025, 09:42 - +48 501 500 860: My calculation was to kinda check and compare what is the difference between sub-like (less protection but less drag) and classic racing harness (safer, more comfort, more drag) - with sub and equalizers you kinda downgrade to classic harness with less safety (at least for bigger sizes L,XL)
30.10.2025, 09:42 - +48 531 197 677: Being a big boy I can carry .5l of drinking water to still fit in an XL enzo. That’s all my ballast. Maybe we should also look into the advantages of pilots that can drop ballast when needed? The pilots with the noodles have to fly with them the whole flight, the pilots with ballast can release ballast according to conditions.
30.10.2025, 09:43 - +39 339 604 2016: Exactly!
30.10.2025, 09:44 - +39 339 604 2016: Its the easyness off our sport!
30.10.2025, 09:44 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: You can fly whatever harness, the size differences would be the same. Can't you see that ?
30.10.2025, 09:45 - +49 1522 2444190: Still i trade safety for performance,  ballast or harness type
30.10.2025, 09:45 - +49 1573 4866279: with the current gen of race harnesses dropping ballast is out of fashion. I haven't seen any good solution until now. Also with the amounts we are talking about most carry solid forms of ballast as the volume of water would be to much
30.10.2025, 09:45 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: this trade off will be completly decorrelated from size equalizers.
30.10.2025, 09:47 - +49 1522 2444190: Why need Equalizers if you can choose to ballast up. Because of safety, right?
30.10.2025, 09:49 - +41 78 870 02 30: This is said with the utmost respect for all current champions and top pilots—however, it is worth questioning whether today’s titles and WPRS truly represent competitive fairness. If the rules were structured to account for pilot weight in a balanced way, how different might our rankings and titles look?
30.10.2025, 09:50 - +49 1522 2444190: As its not the L and XL sized pilots dominating,  i doubt the wprs will look different
30.10.2025, 09:53 - +41 78 870 02 30: Well then how many S flying champions do you know?
30.10.2025, 09:54 - +48 531 197 677: There might only be a small re shuffle at the fringes as I think the thing that is not really being talked about is the quality of pilots in particular groups. If we look at most M-L size pilots they are all relatively fit and a high number of them fly semi professionally 

Most of the top 10-20 in the wprs could step out of the house and run a marathon. 

Not to forget the mindset of going hard and winning.
30.10.2025, 09:54 - +49 1522 2444190: I think Maxime and hono won their first titles on S wings
30.10.2025, 09:56 - +48 531 197 677: How many xs-s size pilots do you know that fly cat 1 and push full bar everywhere thy can?

Percentage wise there are many more M wings than S wings so statistically you’ll be seeing more M size champions, but is this really about the size of wing or the pilot that’s get the title.
30.10.2025, 09:57 - +48 531 197 677: How many XL world champions have there been.
30.10.2025, 09:58 - +49 1573 4866279: but is this because of the pilots skill or because XS (and to a degree S) are more demanding to fly right now as the main R&D work is done on bigger sizes and XS is mostly added on because of CCC requirements?
30.10.2025, 10:00 - +49 1522 2444190: And why would that suddenly change. We jave already the second gen of ccc
30.10.2025, 10:01 - +49 1522 2444190: Chicken and egg
30.10.2025, 10:02 - +41 78 870 02 30: We’re long past debating whether weight-based unfairness exists in paragliding comps—if that weren’t true, none of us would be here. The question now is simply how long it will take to address it fairly. Let’s stop arguing about whether there’s a problem and start fixing it.
30.10.2025, 10:03 - +49 1573 4866279: because with equalisers there is an incentive to fly smaller sizes -> they are sold more often -> manufacturers can put more work into them. Luc already stated they would do extra load tests and linesets for each size with equalisers being used in high level comps
30.10.2025, 10:04 - +49 1522 2444190: This was already, said with introduction of ccc that forced manufacturers to make small wings
30.10.2025, 10:05 - +48 531 197 677: It’s not about arguing but looking at as may perspectives as possible to then take all of them into account when forming solutions
30.10.2025, 10:18 - +39 339 604 2016: To put it brutaly, there are sports with physical limits. I can't be a downhill skier at 76 kg or a basketball player at 179 cm. Sportsmanship exists; otherwise, all those "lighter" winners wouldn't have won. In the 90s and 2000s, the difference was really significant! But not anymore.
30.10.2025, 10:19 - +39 339 604 2016: Are you shure about this?
30.10.2025, 10:20 - +39 339 604 2016: Luc is there a change to have a size between XS and S or SM and ML?
30.10.2025, 10:20 - +49 1573 4866279: About which part? Flying smaller sizes when they become more competitive and manageable to fly? You bet.
30.10.2025, 10:23 - +39 339 604 2016: Will see who is the first to go a size down at toplevel!
30.10.2025, 10:28 - +41 78 870 02 30: Are you really suggesting that the difference between an XS and an L Enzo is negligible? 
If so, you must have insights that the rest of the community doesn’t include Luc and Bruce Data.
Please, share your wisdom of what the actual performance differences are.
30.10.2025, 10:30 - +39 339 604 2016: How many fly an XS in PWC or toplevel?
30.10.2025, 10:30 - +39 339 604 2016: I can say that in glide my M is the same as alberto vitales XL.
30.10.2025, 10:31 - +39 339 604 2016: Eichholzer win Races with S
30.10.2025, 10:32 - +44 7473 068445: I am interested to see how many pilots on M could actually fly S size without their ballast. 
If everyone sized down. Would we see Small Enzo3 on the podium more often for example.
Also if more small sizes in PWC perhaps XS will be flown more in the future.
30.10.2025, 10:32 - Mateusz Gajczewski: On the other hand, there are sports where limits are based on height or body weight. In ski jumping, for instance, rules were introduced after athletes began losing excessive weight to gain an advantage. The length of skis is now tied to a jumper’s height and BMI, which helps discourage unhealthy weight loss. This ensures fair competition and protects athletes’ health.
30.10.2025, 10:32 - +41 78 870 02 30: OMG, That’s the point, an XS in not competitive in top races because of the disadvantage
30.10.2025, 10:32 - +39 339 604 2016: This is what i can say from practice
30.10.2025, 10:33 - +39 339 604 2016: As i bruataly say you can not be a downhillskier with 75 kg.. just am example <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 10:36 - +49 1573 4866279: https://www.weltski.de/en/person/sp43/alpine-skiing/pe241958/zan-kranjec/ but with 77kg you can?
30.10.2025, 10:42 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: yes, there is some chances, as there will be more incentive for manufacturers to do so.
30.10.2025, 10:47 - +34 692 82 41 02: Completely agree, it’s part of the sport and there’s some down sides of being big too. It like if you ballast a marathon runner just because he’s to light so has to use less energy than his competitors
30.10.2025, 10:48 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: but in our sport, I don't think we want to put the merit on body weight. We want to put it on decision making, whatever is your body weight.
30.10.2025, 10:49 - +34 692 82 41 02: Luc but with equalisers you are making then a disadvantage to people who cannot step down to a lower side, it’s not my case, I could fly a M instead of my L, even though I’d be super tight on it. But with equalisers then you’ll have a L glider that flies like a Xs, but still with the handling of a L size
30.10.2025, 10:49 - +34 692 82 41 02: Just as an example
30.10.2025, 10:50 - +34 692 82 41 02: In the end any sport has both parts, physical and mental ones
30.10.2025, 10:50 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: no, if they are done correctly, you can keep an XL and still win.
30.10.2025, 10:50 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: it's just making size performance more equalized
30.10.2025, 10:50 - +34 692 82 41 02: I think there’s a problem to be fixed, but I don’t think equalisers are the solution
30.10.2025, 10:50 - +34 692 82 41 02: But the handling will never be the same
30.10.2025, 10:51 - +34 692 82 41 02: You have flown both sizes and I’m sure you noticed that
30.10.2025, 10:51 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: it's taken in to account in the equalizer. The glide is still a bit better for the larger size
30.10.2025, 10:52 - +34 692 82 41 02: How can you take into account things like glider handling? Just curiosity
30.10.2025, 10:52 - +34 692 82 41 02: I think it’s something pretty difficult to measure
30.10.2025, 10:52 - +34 692 82 41 02: But it’s obvious that a bigger glider struggles in tight and broken thermals
30.10.2025, 10:52 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: for sure, but comes a point where you find an equilibrium
30.10.2025, 10:53 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: an equibrium where it's not anymore a race for who's ballasting the most.
30.10.2025, 10:53 - +49 1573 4866279: and xs ones struggle because of bigger pitch amplitudes when moving through them
30.10.2025, 10:54 - +34 692 82 41 02: And again, just to be peaky. What if because I’m really big, my forearms and hands are much bigger? I’m just taking it to the extreme, but if we want to make everything super fair, then everything must be taken into account
30.10.2025, 10:55 - +34 692 82 41 02: What I’m trying to say is that in every sport there’s differences, wether is the equipment, physiognomy or any other factor. I’m sure sizes don’t affect the same way in every place. In my opinion equalisers can take into account all these factors
30.10.2025, 10:55 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Forearms is another subject. And I don't think there is an issue here that we need to adress.
30.10.2025, 10:55 - +49 1522 2444190: I see us flying with foam around our arms and heads
30.10.2025, 10:56 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: yes, but here we just want to adress ballast issue. Not other things.
30.10.2025, 10:56 - +34 692 82 41 02: Im not trying to say ballast is not an issue
30.10.2025, 10:57 - +34 692 82 41 02: Im just trying to say that maybe we should find a solution that won’t create some disadvantages in order to fix some others
30.10.2025, 11:00 - Julien Garcia: Just a note with admin cap on. I don't believe this free talks here will help the community steering somewhere.

30.10.2025, 11:00 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: When comparing sports we have to differentiate those played only with our bodies from those played with machines

Car racing for example favors less weight. This involves ballasting cars to reach some minimun weight
30.10.2025, 11:02 - Julien Garcia: Try to remind whatever your point of view is, this community is very narrow and we mostly want to improve our sport even if we can't agree on how just now. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>

30.10.2025, 11:58 - +41 76 465 96 05: I think it is. Because forarms create more drag then the whole harness. It is why small pilots with a lot of balast can have an advantage. (It is not modled correctly in your calculation, but disadvantage due to inertia isn't either.)

As a big guy who was forced out of the sport I love (>125kg 😢) I am still in favour of equalizers. Just imagine everyody could show up with 12kg gear. It is what makes the beauty of our sport. It is better to have them even without ballast limitation.
Maybe we would need to adjust the rules a bit, but it is doable) <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 12:19 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: The question is if the resistance to equalizers is philosophical or methodological
30.10.2025, 12:20 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: If we think M and L have the same performance then we tweak eq and give them the same noodle
30.10.2025, 12:21 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: If we think XS is still handicapped, then we reduce more its noodle
30.10.2025, 12:27 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: CCC is already a degraded machine. It is not the best performance we can get. It is perhaps the best performance under the current rules that impose limits. If equalizers were born at the same time than CCC perhaps it would have been easier to accept
30.10.2025, 12:38 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: The biggest doubt I have with equalizers, is if after all this, the < 65 kg pilots will still fly 95 or 105 kg PTV because they feel is their best option <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>

30.10.2025, 13:10 - +358 44 5063309: To me it feels a bit distorted that we are flying drag optimized super sleekly harness with a napkin as back protector and adding foam to the lines instead.
30.10.2025, 13:21 - +44 7446 445157: It seems the designers, at least Luc & Bruce, agree on the ball-park performance advantage of larger gliders over small.

Is this advantage consistent across all glider classes (CCC through to EN-A) ?  

(It appears the BGD weightless applies MRT across all glider classes.)
30.10.2025, 13:34 - +41 76 465 96 05: From a pure performance standpoint, it would be the most advantageous solution. Even today, jumping two sizes with ballast can provide a noticeable performance edge. This effect also becomes clear when using a body-size model based on DIN CEN ISO/TR 7250-2.

Compared to the current setup, the performance gain relative to the smaller size would be reduced, while the advantage over the larger size would increase.

But as far as I saw, there is not much mentioned also, why "M" glider is the best sweet spot.
Yes, bigger gliders fly better, safer, etc... 
I also fly with ballast, to be on M. I switched to S size for one seasson. It was nightmare. I was always struggling!! The difference is noticable! As long as you are on the better side (and mybe just for a bit!) you dont notice the advantage!
So the M is sweetspot also because its mostly the size, from which all the design begins. And it has enormous R&D, fine tunning time on it, etc... even, if the manufacturers would now say, that they will put more effort into S, it wont be as good as M. Im pretty sure!!
Also, the noodles, WON'T make the "equalising" job, also becasue of all that said. Not to mention, its ridiculous to use them, where we can try to optimise every bit for performance!! And one is teory/calculations, another is practice. They just wont do the job.
Ballast is the "price" top competitor has to take in to account, if s/he wants to be on top. 
I would say, that overall safety is not much bigger (if at all), without ballast and flying S or even XS, than M and up, with balast. As said there is bigger workload on smaller glider and less overall safety on it. So in overall, gain on one side, but loose on the other. ("Gain only": easiness at take off and landing. But, this only applies for bad conditions and BAD places. If TO and LZ are OK, then no worries. So better to concentrate to improve those parts! And leave the ballast to everyone's choice!)
IF we MUST go to "equalising" between sizes, then it's better to choose the least worse option, which is weight ranges. Probably 2 or 3 ranges would do the job. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 14:54 - +44 7815 693738: There doesn’t have to be bigger workload on smaller gliders though. Small gliders can be made nice too if there was a market for them.

30.10.2025, 16:57 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: A good start ! Now we need to structure how to work on it
30.10.2025, 16:57 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: <Pominięto multimedia>
30.10.2025, 17:01 - +33 7 86 12 62 36: Agree ! Thanks Mateusz !
30.10.2025, 17:02 - Julien Garcia: Some general comments :
1) Pilots data on surveys are usually lost forever. This community have seen such surveys in the past. Results have been published but collected data have never been capitalized. If we believe theses datas are good let's store them in a user profile instead so we can reuse for other questions. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 17:06 - Julien Garcia: 2) Most pilots will answer question according to the scope they know and love.  CAT1 PWC SRS National leisure comp. It is certainly the case that a pilot believe a solution could work somewhere but not somewhere else. In my opinion we should Primary chase this. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 17:07 - Julien Garcia: Otherwise I aknowledge superior insight in this survey than simple single choiced vote <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
30.10.2025, 17:07 - Julien Garcia: Very good work 🙏🏻
30.10.2025, 17:15 - Mateusz Gajczewski: 1) I agree that all (or most) of Demographics section can be stored in user profile.
2) Personally, I would add in the Problem Perception section question(s) about where this problem is most visible and where it should be addressed first.
But yes, as Eduardo said, we'd need to structure for how to refine this survey to be correct, complete, objective and unbiased
30.10.2025, 17:25 - Mateusz Gajczewski: I can give anyone who wants it permission on GitHub to _create an issue_ or submit a _pull request_ (request to apply certain change) . Just PM me, and we can test how it would work.

30.10.2025, 20:06 - +420 737 683 261: Hi, just quickly skimmed through the past conversation so sorry if this is something that has already been said. I’m all in favor of equalizing the performance, but I find the noodles to be somewhat awkward. Wouldn’t it be possible to create same drag for each glider by simply using thicker lines? So the glider is pre-equalized straight from the factory
30.10.2025, 20:09 - +1 (850) 702-1893: I doubt people would like to have a perma-equalized glider
30.10.2025, 20:11 - +1 (415) 994-8200: That said, there were some rule/procedure changes suggested that would allow manufacturers to scale lines on smaller sizes (lower load) rather than using the same max-load size on all. This could make the smaller sizes perma-optimized perhaps 🙂
30.10.2025, 20:13 - +1 (510) 299-3701: In theory that only takes care of part of the advantage of the larger sizes.

But it could allow using smaller equalizers in future if the rule were adopted.
30.10.2025, 20:14 - +1 (415) 994-8200: Could be a step in the right direction though and should upset very few people?
30.10.2025, 20:18 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: I think nobody is really thinking - Oh, I would really love to have those kite control bar floats happily erect in my B1 lines !!!  Where can I get them ?
It will be awkward for everyone, not only you Ondrej !!
If we finally use them, it is just because we are convinced it will solve a problem (or at least partially) whose solution we have been procrastinating for quite a long time.
30.10.2025, 20:25 - +420 737 683 261: Yes, I get that, as I also wouldn’t want to compromise on glide when doing xc flights. But from my point of view CCC is a competition glider, which should be primarily used on competitions. If we were to create CCC 2026 as Luc has already proposed, we could “bake in” the drag equalizer that way. As I said before, I’m not sure if this is going to work as I don’t know a lot about physics and I’ve never designed a glider myself. That’s why I formulated my message as a question

30.10.2025, 20:38 - +351 914 026 612: I'm a lightweight pilot. I weigh 54 kg and my total weight without ballast is between 78 and 80 kg. I've been flying since 1993, and in the past I flew CCC and D wings. Currently, I've moved to class C because I thought it would offer more safety combined with good performance. However, what I feel, besides the issue related to size XS or S – greater dynamics and more work in controlling the wing – is that C wings (I've flown wings of this category from two different brands) may be more resistant to collapses, but when they happen, they are much more violent compared to any wing I've flown in the past. So how should I proceed? Control the pitch more? To the point of not letting it fly at all? Because even then, controlling the pitch much more, I end up having violent collapses in thermal flight, with the feeling that I'm lucky not to fall inside the wing. What has been in my favor is having height, with a significant drop to the ground. But how long does that luck last? Right now, this is the dilemma I'm facing with this new generation of wings: I don't want XS or S wings anymore because their reactions are unpredictable. With an M wing, I'd have to carry the same weight I have as a person in terms of ballast. Even if I went to the gym like Pamela (whom I admire immensely), I'd never be able to manage it.
30.10.2025, 21:23 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Probably a development/trimming issue. Having more pilots flying smaller sizes because it’s less of a disadvantage can only be good for getting more work put into smaller sizes.

It’s also possible that you had bad luck with that size of those two brands and that size in a third brand would be better.

There are even bad individual gliders in M size that collapse too easily, so it’s risky to generalize too much from one or two examples.

It does seem like a failure of the EN testing regime when gliders that pass with standard collapses behave badly with real world ones.
