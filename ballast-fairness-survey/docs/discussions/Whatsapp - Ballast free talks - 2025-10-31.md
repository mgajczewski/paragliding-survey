What's standardized is the collapse. The pilot's execution of it doesn't matter. An EN C glider that collapses too deeply at high speed, outside the standard range, with a basic maneuver to trigger the collapse, leads the test pilot to search for the standardized collapse and find solutions to achieve the correct one. What happens in real life is something else entirely...

31.10.2025, 02:27 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I realize it would be hard to test real life collapses, though maybe something like sloppy wingover or off heading fast spiral exit could create something more realistic?

I also don't think we can find a more efficient maneuver to induce collapses while getting closer to reality. One reason is that there isn't "one" but "many" realities. Our gliders don't always collapse in the same way in real-life situations. In my opinion, it's impossible to reproduce them. The consequence of all this? Don't hide behind a letter, C or B or whatever, but improve your piloting skills!
