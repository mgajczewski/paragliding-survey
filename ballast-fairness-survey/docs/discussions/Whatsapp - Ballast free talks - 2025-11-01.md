I think Eduardo mentioned before that CAT1’s and weight classes, and in your document it says “a mess logistically”. So I have a question for the group in preparation for next weeks meeting on the weight class proposal. Do you think it would be a mess? What would be the solution? How would you imagine it being done in CAT1’s?

Turbulence affects small and large paragliders very differently: smaller wings react faster and more abruptly, while larger wings are more stable and less affected. In simple terms, a pilot flying a small wing must deal with significantly more physical and mental workload in turbulent air. According to studies carried out by BGD, this additional workload is around 25% higher.

There are also well-known studies from NASA and other sources supporting this principle. Based on pilot interviews, the real-world difference can be even higher than 25%, especially on long and demanding tasks.
