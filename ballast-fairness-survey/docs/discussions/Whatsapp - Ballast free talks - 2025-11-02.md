Is it just me or do the rebuttal comments to the MRT objections seem not fully thought through ?  Maybe the discussion hasn't covered those rebuttals ?
02.11.2025, 15:09 - +386 31 404 688: Yes, it seems to have missed the few key aspects of MRT that need to be understood and should be listed. Maybe these were all presented in the video chat. I wasn't watching and I guess AI missed it 😊

You should avoid an MRT waypoint in the first 10km, to allow pilots to separate before pilots start turning 180 degrees on a turnpoint. This is even more important when ridges are involved in the mountains. Turnppoints away from the ridge are good for safety, but this requires heavier pilots to fly out further from the lift band.

You need to avoid an MRT turnpoint in the last 10km as this could severely affect a pilots calculations in knowing what he must do to beat a fellow pilot.

MRT turnpoints need consideration in the mountains so as not to push heavy pilots too deep into terrain.

Tasks straight to goal don't have waypoints to MRT. Some clever tasking in the middle can add something but the task committee needs to consider how to do this within the terrain available to them.

MRT relies on the task committee to calculate how to make a fair task to equalise the scoring fairness so a degree of training is needed for task committees. At present there are no formal training courses available within CIVL.

MRT is fantastic when applied to something like Glider classes. Sports pilots. To help the very low performance wings to enjoy a bit more of the task rather then be decked at the first into wind turnpoint. It can work well for weight on lower ranked events, providing all the above is observed and understood.
