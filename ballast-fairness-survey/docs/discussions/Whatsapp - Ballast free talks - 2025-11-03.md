03.11.2025, 08:20 - +44 7815 693738: ☝️also this, any comments?
03.11.2025, 08:29 - +33 7 86 12 62 36: Mentionned also : when MRT center is the place of a (known) thermal then the advantage for light pilots (having the possibility to turn away earlier) is not so real
03.11.2025, 15:09 - +41 78 870 02 30: Hi Malin, Regardless of which solution is eventually proposed, it will need to be properly organized, designed, and supported by clear rule modifications and implementation steps. Of course, feasibility should be considered — but isn’t it a bit early to focus on adoptability before we’ve explored the options in depth?

A few thoughts on the organization of weight classes:
We’ve already seen the Reynolds Class introduced in some Class 2 competitions, which could serve as a good starting point for bringing similar categories into CAT1 events.

Once the initial structure is established, additional weight categories could gradually be introduced based on pilot selection and wings.

One of the biggest advantages of introducing weight classes is that it doesn’t fundamentally change flight strategy, equipment choice, pilot training, experience, or scoring systems.
By creating a new CAT 1 class such as the Reynolds Class, we simply add an incentive for pilots to compete and succeed within their natural range, using suitable and readily available equipment — ideally without, or at least with significantly less, ballast.
03.11.2025, 15:16 - +386 31 404 688: Also, consider Reynolds class at 95kg has failed twice at the plenary already.
03.11.2025, 15:17 - +386 31 404 688: A fresh approach will help
03.11.2025, 15:18 - +49 1573 4866279: <Pominięto multimedia>
03.11.2025, 15:20 - +386 31 404 688: The French were quite against on the first presentation. They wanted it increased to 105kg as I remember. 

I can't really remember much discussion the second. Not that I participated in anyway. Maybe the minutes will reveal something.
03.11.2025, 15:21 - +386 31 404 688: The success at SRS though would be a good reference as to how it can work successfully
03.11.2025, 15:22 - +44 7815 693738: I thought this group was set up to talk about the pros and cons of each idea. If CAT1’s would be a block then it’s not worth pursuing it. I can’t see a problem with it but others have mentioned there might be so I’m trying to involve the group to discuss the details so we can talk about them in the next meeting. Out of interest, if weight categories gets accepted, why would we gradually introduce it? Part of pilots frustration is that it is taking years for any change, why do it slowly?
03.11.2025, 15:45 - Martin Scheel: I think weight classes (or MRI) are good for competitions below CCC. 
For the top class, it would be a loss. It would further diminish the value of a title. Even today, hardly anyone knows who was European champion. If we now introduce further classes, the value of the titles 'world champion' and 'Continental champion' will continue to decline. 
In addition, weight checks are difficult. 
For CCC Class we should use equalizer.
03.11.2025, 15:48 - +386 31 404 688: That is a very fair point from Martin.

I already feel the Sports Worlds will introduce that type of factor.

Weight classes are being considered as a way to improve safety in ballast etc. But all other ways of tackling the problem should first be explored.
03.11.2025, 16:06 - +41 78 870 02 30: Ironically, this is exactly the kind of organizer-centric thinking we’re trying to move away from — to make competitions safer, fairer, and more inclusive.

Many competitions already use a weight class system, such as the 95 kg / Reynolds Class, and it works well. So it’s hard to understand why introducing similar structures more broadly is seen as such a challenge.

If we continue ignoring the imbalance, we risk losing pilots — not just because of unfair competitive conditions, but also because some push themselves to dangerous extremes trying to match weight. In the long run, there won’t be any titles left to defend if the sport keeps discouraging or endangering its own participants.
03.11.2025, 16:11 - +44 7815 693738: You wouldn’t need weight checks. You would need to register what weight class you were going to fly at the beginning of the season and then turn up with the appropriate wing size, which would be easy to check. There is no getting over the fact there would multiple champions, but does that really matter as long as pilots are safer? You don’t watch boxing, or sailing and scoff at the winners thinking “yes well they are only the best in the world in their category”. You witness them being the best in the world at what they do. If people can’t currently keep track of one winner then it doesn’t make any difference to them if there is more, they still won’t know! Equalisers seem like they need a lot of testing in real world conditions before they could be fairly introduced, weight categories could bridge the gap as it could be implemented much quicker.
03.11.2025, 16:20 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: I am yet to see a detailed proposal for weight classes in a CAT1.
We cannot debate about what does not exist
03.11.2025, 16:26 - +44 7815 693738: Then why not propose something? Or come up with some pros and cons of how it could work. This is a group set up to literally talk about ideas to be made in to a proposal, not talk about wanting to see a proposal.
03.11.2025, 16:36 - +34 656 49 91 05: I’m sure there are solutions for every issue here if we work on it. The only thing that would be lost is the “1 Overall Champion”.
Anyway, it seems we are looping again back to the start of the debate..We need the table for pros/cons for every option.. and then make the voting for one choice.. and go for it and start working on it
03.11.2025, 16:37 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Because I think it is a very bad idea. So I cannot make proposals over something I disagree.
It is for the proponents of the idea to make the proposal
03.11.2025, 16:38 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I wouldn’t say Reynolds Class has been a huge success in the US. It doesn’t seem to have influenced serious competitors to carry less ballast. It’s fine, it doesn’t hurt anything to give away another minor trophy, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea for a Cat. 1 or going to meaningfully impact safety.

Could people include their name in their Whatsapp profiles? It’s hard to take seriously discussion with someone with a single letter or an emoji for a name.
03.11.2025, 16:38 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I guess what you could do is provide a more detailed description of drawbacks than ‘logistical nightmare’. If you felt like it.
03.11.2025, 16:40 - +44 7815 693738: If you think it’s a bad idea you can come up with a list of cons for it, as people that like the idea are probably going to suggest positive things as we all have a cognitive bias. Your input is important either way.
03.11.2025, 16:42 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Of course Josh. I will do that. I thought it was better to argue against something with more detail, as weight classes ideas have been varied (I have read about a single lightweight without eliminating general classification, and also read about as much categories as 10 kg intervals we can think of and without a general classification)
But I will nevertheless  provide the description of drawbacks I have in my mind
03.11.2025, 16:47 - Martin Scheel: I don't see any safety risk or sporting problem if CCC has to fly with equaliser and the other classes fly with weight classes. I only see one problem: how pilots are allowed to fly in a "mixed" competition. For example, a pilot with EN D in a competition where many CCCs are flying. At Cat 1 there are a few, at the Nationals there are many who do not fly CCC.
03.11.2025, 16:58 - +386 31 404 688: One major obstacle with classes is that of overall champion. 

The entire WPRS system is built upon a single set of results from a competition. To try to have several equal champions from an event would always be undermined by their still being a single winner named and rewarded in the WPRS.

To score them as separate events within the same task is not yet allowed for within wprs so it will need some thought and possible change throughout the entire scoring system.

In CAT2, I think pilots are just happy to make a podium. In CAT1 it would need careful consideration. In the current form, it is an elitist event.
03.11.2025, 17:00 - +44 7815 693738: It would have to be scored as “multiple events” within one comp to be fair for WPRS.
03.11.2025, 17:11 - +386 31 404 688: That is my worry. That suggests the WPRS for each 'event' would be very low, for example. Maybe only 10 pilots in the 'event'.

It would create unique champions, but they would not be competing for wprs under the current system.
03.11.2025, 17:17 - +34 656 49 91 05: but it would be “low” for every event along the year.. and therefore in the end, fair for everyone. But I guess what would make sense is having in the WPRS weight categories as well
03.11.2025, 17:20 - +41 78 870 02 30: @⁨~Brett Janaway (Si)⁩, Isn't the model you used for SRS adoptable for other classes? I mean you have the same issue with SRS wprs right?
03.11.2025, 17:33 - Julien Garcia: It has been several occasion where it happens WPRS is a concern that kind of "forbid" a solution to develop. I'm not satisfyed with the way it "structure" our activity. I'm willing to developp another one based on Elo or Trueskill to fix different issue. (I'm opening another What do we want)
03.11.2025, 17:34 - +41 78 870 02 30: @⁨~Josh Cohn⁩ some guys missed quite a big part of the discussions around fairness and safety — you did a fantastic job summarizing them all into a pro/con table. Would you mind updating and sharing it again? 🙏
03.11.2025, 17:49 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Sure, I can also have notebooklm review this thread again and extract arguments after a while. I edit them to make sure they make sense of course. Also happy to take submissions for brief pro/con/anti-con arguments.
03.11.2025, 18:00 - +386 31 404 688: For other events, it would not be low. CAT2 competitions can do as they want and many organisers focus on achieving high WPRS above all other aspects. Section 7 rules are for CAT1 only. Any rules you propose here would only apply to CAT1 (with some very minor exceptions that apply to CAT2).

So you would have to reinvent the whole WPRS system. But, you can do that. It is entirely possible and then yes, it could apply to CAT2. Just not to underestimate the size of the task.
03.11.2025, 18:09 - +34 656 49 91 05: Sorry, yes, I was assuming it was applied on all competitions..in the end you compete (more less) with the same gear every comp, so it makes sense if we want pilots flying on their preferred weight, competing with their equals
03.11.2025, 18:12 - +44 7815 693738: Couldn’t you just keep the same formula but “duplicate” it to cover multiple categories.
03.11.2025, 18:13 - +44 7446 445157: Yes.  And the consequence would be those events would be low wprs because there are few participants.
03.11.2025, 18:15 - +1 (510) 299-3701: But if all ‘under 95kg’ class comps have low WPRS values then that’s not a problem for comparing them in their own WPRS ranking. It would be like Class 2 hang gliders.

It’s still a huge project, way beyond making some tweaks to the WPRS formula to make it fairer.
03.11.2025, 18:27 - +44 7446 445157: Yes, exactly.  There are many implications to be worked through.
03.11.2025, 18:48 - +44 7446 445157: A few initial questions/ challenges in respect of Weight classes for Cat 1 events.

Cat 1s are nation & individual events.  They're limited to 130 competitors, in the '25 Worlds 12 nations had "full" teams (i.e. 3+1) ref: https://civlcomps.org/event/download-file?filename=9d89739b76f0155d936940789cb3fd46.pdf 

We've heard ideas ranging from 3 up to 10 different weight classes; the number of classes will directly affect some of the implications.

How would nation scoring work ?  The two best individual scores across any weight category (with each weight category scored separately) ? 

Are Nations expected to field a team which covers multiple weight classes ?  Is there a limit to the number a nation could be field in each category ?

We would expect some weight categories to be larger than others. It may be beneficial for a nation to send less skilled competitors in weight class they anticipate to have less competitors than a higher skilled pilot in a larger class.

Weight class champions will be less recognisable than overall champions.  To use the boxing analogy I suggest many more people know the heavyweight (i.e. overall) world champion than the other weight categories.  It's true that only a small proportion of our sport know the current (or former) world champions but it would likely reduce even further thus undermining the prestige of the title.

The over riding concern is that weight classes will change many aspects of the competition and it will be difficult to anticipate them all thus opening the door for a (short term) reduction in "fairness".
03.11.2025, 19:00 - +386 31 404 688: The SRS system is simply this:

<85kg = lightwight
86kg - 100kg = midweight
Overall, all weights.

So we have two weight classes, and one overall. We can't get away from the overall under the current WPRS system, and we recognise that.

*2024*
390 pilots (63 women)
13.6% lightweight
16% Medium weight
16% Women Overall
390 in Overall

*2025*
10% lightweight
22% Medium weight
14% Women Overall
301 in Overall

Interestingly, if you break it down event by event

SRS-2024-1 17% light, 29% medium
SRS-2024-2 11% light, 24% medium
SRS-2024-3 14% light, 20% medium
SRS-2024-4  7% light, 29% medium
SRS-2024-5 12% light, 30% medium
SRS-2025-1 14% light, 23% medium
SRS-2025-2  8% light, 20% medium
SRS-2025-3  8% light, 18% medium
SRS-2025-4  8% light, 27% medium

What this demonstrates is that medium weight pilots in particular are committing to the full season, and thus appear as a smaller number in the overalls for the full year. Heavier pilots bounce in and out, so appear to be greater in number overall.

The lightweight pilots appear to be either reducing or carrying more ballast as the SRS develops.

What I also know is, we do not get complaints of ballast or weight in the SRS. Pilots are very happy with the system. So far.....
03.11.2025, 19:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: Midweight includes also the lightweights - right ?
03.11.2025, 19:02 - +386 31 404 688: No

They are exclusive
03.11.2025, 19:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: Why not ?!?
03.11.2025, 19:04 - +386 31 404 688: That is important for several reasons, but not least, to get different pilots onto the podium Pal wins enough already without having him mopping up every weight category as well as Standard and Overall class 😂
03.11.2025, 19:04 - Sopot - Meet Director: If Overall includes all, then midweight must include lightweight
03.11.2025, 19:05 - Sopot - Meet Director: Only the lightweight category must be on it's own
03.11.2025, 19:05 - +386 31 404 688: In your definition. Not ours. That's the beauty of a CAT2 😊
03.11.2025, 19:06 - +386 31 404 688: We are looking for the best pilot in a certain weight band.

You don't mix them in boxing!
03.11.2025, 19:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: It's strange for me that the two concepts are mixed
03.11.2025, 19:07 - +44 7446 445157: In which case why not a heavy weight rather than overall (incl the lower weight categories)? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
03.11.2025, 19:07 - +1 (510) 299-3701: One way of structuring it would be to have several completely separate classes/events. A problem is that there would be many more in the middle weight and not many in the light and heavy categories. You might have to combine light and heavy to get an economy of scale. Similar to how the class 2 HG and womens HG worlds were combined.
03.11.2025, 19:08 - +1 (510) 299-3701: But even though the comp infrastructure is combined the tasks and scoring should be separate.
03.11.2025, 19:09 - +386 31 404 688: If WPRS didn't insist on us presenting Overalls, we would have heavyweight, not overalls. We can't avoid overalls, so we accept it.

Most of the time you would see a pilot over 100kg on the top of the podium, so having heavyweight would be the same as Overall. Duplication of trophies etc.

But the last two seasons could be said to be challenging that. I will go away and consider that.
03.11.2025, 19:09 - +41 78 870 02 30: If SRS wouldn’t have overall they can’t even qualify as CAT2 and get WPRS
03.11.2025, 19:10 - +386 31 404 688: We could present the podium different to how we present WPRS results. But pilots chasing WPRS (don't we all) would know that and chase the points anyway. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
03.11.2025, 19:11 - +1 (510) 299-3701: there is not a requirement for overall if they are doing different tasks of course. that would mean fewer WPRS points for each sub-event, but in the context of weight class specific WPRS rankings that wouldn’t matter.
03.11.2025, 19:11 - +44 7446 445157: If the aim is to find the best pilot in each weight class do just that.
Overalls for WPRS could be submitted but not be mentioned in the SRS titles. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
03.11.2025, 19:12 - +386 31 404 688: In fact, the very first BGD Weightless had 3 mutually exclusive weight champions and no overall winner.

For me, that was the most successful BGD Weightless event. But it would not work in CAT1, IMO. Certainly not until the WPRS issue is resolved.
03.11.2025, 19:13 - +1 (510) 299-3701: there is a difference between being the winner of a task (comp) and a winner of a subcategory within a task(comp). one requires more independent decision-making than the other.
03.11.2025, 19:13 - +386 31 404 688: Sorry, it I shard enough managing one task. I am not running three separate ones at the same time 😬
03.11.2025, 19:14 - Sopot - Meet Director: In paragliding we all accepted the "inclusive categories" - if some group of people has a disadvantage - there is a separate category for those people, but they are also included in the "upper" categories
03.11.2025, 19:15 - +1 (510) 299-3701: it is the status quo, true, but it creates a sort of second class title.
03.11.2025, 19:15 - Sopot - Meet Director: EN-B gliders are included in any category for EN-C
03.11.2025, 19:16 - +386 31 404 688: Anyway. This, for me, is all an aside.

This is how the SRS does it. We have 300-450 members participate per season. We have no complaints I am aware of from our members. It is our members. The SRS is not CIVL. But you are welcome to look at what the SRS does and see if there are lessons to be learnt.
03.11.2025, 19:18 - +41 78 870 02 30: How about introducing a lightweight class in the same way the women’s class is handled — keeping WPRS unchanged, or alternatively applying a simple adjustment formula to WPRS for lightweight pilots?
This would keep the implementation straightforward and manageable.
03.11.2025, 19:20 - +1 (510) 299-3701: An adjustment formula is handicapping, which Bruce described having tried and discarded for his comps.
03.11.2025, 19:22 - +44 7815 693738: Let’s be honest, a complete overhaul of the WPRS formula is not hard. It would involve putting the existing one in to AI, explaining the new rules and waiting all of 10 seconds for it to do the hard work…
03.11.2025, 19:33 - +34 656 49 91 05: I have an important concern: What would happen with women's categories?
Because most probably, they would need 2 or 3 weight categories. Is up to them to say how to they feel about it. Will they be OK having a mixed (men & women) category?
In my opinion, they are more than capable of beating men on their own weight class.
Otherwise, we would be on start point 0 for women, because they will want to win the overall women category therefore most probably over-ballasting.
But at the same time it would be very bad having f.e. some competitions (class 2) with only 1, 2 or 3 women in each weight category. Or this would be OK?
03.11.2025, 20:03 - +44 7815 693738: In my opinion there would be no need for a woman’s category. The lower weight classes would be dominated by them and the male pilots that were in those categories would be the minority. The women would have more of a chance at winning an “overall” category this way.
03.11.2025, 20:13 - +1 (850) 702-1893: Please don’t conflate weight classes and gender categories. 

We don’t have a women’s class because women are light. We have a women’s class because women are underrepresented in the sport. These may be related but they’re not the same.
03.11.2025, 20:28 - +34 656 49 91 05: how do you foresee these weight categories for women if were introduced?
03.11.2025, 20:36 - +386 31 404 688: Just for info. Women's participation

In our NAC (GBR), it is presently: *6.1%*
In the WPRS it is: *8.5%*
In the SRS it is: *15%*
03.11.2025, 20:39 - +44 7815 693738: They’re not, but is there any evidence that having a woman’s category has done anything to increase the numbers? The top female pilots that I have discussed this with, which to be fair aren’t many, are against a woman’s category, they want to be seen as equal and when they fuck up a comp and come 70th and still get up and win a medal they are embarrassed. If you kept a woman’s category, they would have to ballast up to the heaviest woman’s size to be competitive, defeating the point of all this, so they would be better off, and more likely to win, in their own weight (mixed) category. If you had weight categories for women there wouldn’t be enough in each category to make it viable, so you are back to an overall winner and the lightest pilots ballasting up. Back to square one just in a different gender. In my opinion it wouldn’t be fair on women if men had weight categories and could fly without ballast and women were still scored overall and having to ballast up. Unless something drastically changes there will never be enough women in this sport to make their own weight categories viable. So, what other solution is there to propose that would be fair and rid the sport of ballast?
03.11.2025, 21:11 - +34 656 49 91 05: I understand both points, and this is for me the biggest issue .
Is it possible to do a poll just for women?
03.11.2025, 21:13 - +386 31 404 688: I would suggest, that is a poll for CIVL to make at some point. But it would have to be part of a larger poll on other topics too.
03.11.2025, 21:48 - +1 (850) 702-1893: To be clear - there is excellent evidence in multiple sports that having a visible women’s podium increases participation, but it does take time. There’s no reason to think that free flight is an exception to this. 

I give the anecdote often of beginning to compete some years ago and having very little evidence that women were participating in competition, it being hard to identify whether there were any women in an average competition’s results list, etc. It was fairly discouraging.

I come from ultra running, which has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years - and I experienced the same thing often - I’d run races in which I might be one of 5-10% women taking part. I appreciated a women’s category because it lent legitimacy to us participating. Marathon running and ultra running has now become much more gender equal, and there have been multiple efforts to elevate attention to the women’s category (the podium project, here for the women’s race, etc).

I don’t think we can expect such exponential growth in our sport, but we have excellent examples of why we should continue to support a women’s category if we want to have women competing.
03.11.2025, 21:51 - +44 7815 693738: How would you solve the ballast issue amongst women?
03.11.2025, 21:51 - +44 7815 693738: I’ve done some rough figures, I’ll post them below:
03.11.2025, 21:52 - +44 7815 693738: <Pominięto multimedia>
03.11.2025, 21:52 - +44 7815 693738: <Pominięto multimedia>
03.11.2025, 21:53 - +44 7815 693738: I’ve based this whole thing on the idea that a complete flying setup weighs 15 kilos. Right now, competition gear usually comes in quite a bit heavier than that, but I’m imagining a future setup where everything’s been made lighter.

These weight categories are designed so that no pilot would ever have to fly with more than 10 kilos of ballast. This is really the minimum number of weight ranges that still makes that possible. Any fewer, and someone would inevitably end up needing to carry more ballast just to stay competitive. The only other way to reduce the number of categories would be to move the very heavy pilots down into the lighter band — but that would be unfair on everyone else in that category, because they’d have to fly against pilots with bigger wings. So if the goal is to properly solve the ballast problem, I don’t see a fair way to have fewer weight categories than this.
03.11.2025, 21:54 - +1 (850) 702-1893: Thanks for the weight distribution chart.
03.11.2025, 21:54 - +1 (850) 702-1893: I don’t think we have enough people to make weight categories compelling, personally, though I’m open to being convinced.
03.11.2025, 21:54 - +44 7815 693738: To build this, I started by looking at global population data for body weights, but I removed the obese end of the scale, because realistically there just aren’t obese people flying in competitions.

Since we don’t have accurate pilot weight data, I’ve had to generalise from the overall population and make some assumptions based on what would be a reasonable spread for active pilots. From there, I took the total number of registered pilots — 7,054, including 601 women — and distributed them into weight categories using global averages as a guide. I added 15 kilos to represent a full flying setup, so all the figures are total flying weights rather than just body weights.

That gave a realistic spread of where pilots are likely to sit across the different weight ranges. The lighter categories are mostly female, the heaviest are almost all male, and the majority of pilots fall somewhere in the middle, around 80 to 100 kilos flying weight. It’s not exact, but it’s a fair model based on what we know and what you’d expect to see in real competitions.
03.11.2025, 21:56 - +1 (850) 702-1893: I don’t think there is a need to “solve the ballast issue among women.” I think there is a need to solve the ballast issue.
03.11.2025, 21:56 - +1 (850) 702-1893: I know small men and large women.
03.11.2025, 21:56 - +1 (850) 702-1893: If we’re solely trying to solve the physics equation of big wings go better, that’s a genderless problem.
03.11.2025, 22:00 - +44 7815 693738: Yes but if there are not enough women to have their own weight categories then there is still a ballast problem.
03.11.2025, 22:02 - +1 (850) 702-1893: Sure - as I said I don’t find weight categories very compelling because they tend to divide the population into little pieces
03.11.2025, 22:35 - +44 7809 154353: In all sports where there are categories, if there is an overall that is where the focus is. Categories work for boxing because there is no overall. But for running where there are age categories the overall dominates. In paragliding cat 2 comps we have Reynolds, Sports etc. but the the overall is still the prize everyone wants. Therefore if we want an inclusive sport then overall must be equalised so the playing field is as fair as possible.
Or remove the overall podium. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
03.11.2025, 22:54 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Agreed. Though I suspect if overall was removed then the M size category might just become the most prestigious one, since at least currently it’s where 75%+ (or at least a significant majority) of pilots are at. And it would likely not dissuade anyone from ballasting up to that size. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
03.11.2025, 22:55 - +54 9 3548 50-3363: I think this discussion is showing to all of us growth pains (excuse my language). Our sport is growing! Which is in some way, good news. Under the assumption we are looking into creating an environment that embraces more pilots towards competition I allow myself to share:
In my opinion, making focus on categories will inevitably generate each category to grow. My take is to leave the overall scoring aside and migrate to a per category scoring.

Comparing to a rally race… let’s say Dakar, y don’t think there is an overall category… each category has its own focus and spotlight. 

Not sure what the WPRS impacts may have, but for sure it should be adapted if there is a criteria change.
03.11.2025, 23:50 - +351 918 194 767: Great chart Malin.
Is this the weight of a naked pilot, or total weight in flight?

If total weight in flight, then  it makes sense to also know if these are comp pilots only or general population.  Comp pilot gear is a lot heavier as we all know.  My intuition is that the majority of comp pilots are way above 100kg in flight.
03.11.2025, 23:51 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Malin described the methodology about 8 posts up.
