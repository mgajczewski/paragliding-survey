04.11.2025, 00:06 - +351 918 194 767: i think we have to come up with a different method. 
Global population data will include many mal-nourished countries. If we remove obese, we cannot keep these. 
Also, on global population, there's a over representation of Asian countries, with much smaller body types (and they are a minority in terms of pilots).
 
Probalby a better approach would be an estimatiion based on global sales of wings (under C), where pilots dont have so much incentive to use ballast for performance. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
04.11.2025, 00:07 - Mateusz Gajczewski: I’m between sizes S and M, and it’s not appealing for me to have to decide in which category I want to compete, who among my friends I’ll be competing with, and which ranking I’ll appear in. Naturally, the larger and stronger group would be more attractive to me (more prestigious). I imagine that most of the lighter pilots would add ballast anyway to compete with the best, and since heavier ones don’t have that choice, the migration goes only one way. The only option I could see would be to hold separate or additional competitions for lighter pilots at a different time – nice idea, but it doesn’t really solve the problem.

If they are willing to share (possibly de identified data would be best) that would be a decently accurate source of actual weight vs wing size data
04.11.2025, 02:56 - +44 7446 445157: If you recall, Julien recently added weight data in our gagglereport profile.  If we all fill that in we will have useful data.

I worry that doing a halfway weight class thing could draw support away from equalizers without really solving/changing anything.

We already have lightweight class in many Cat. 2s but they haven’t really changed ballasting behavior from what I’ve seen.

Spotted: an AI hallucination in the summary: “MRT (Mathematical Race Time)”
