06.11.2025, 21:44 - +34 615 39 61 88: Why can't it be an option to have weight categories and eliminate the overall ranking? This way there in no incentive to carry ballast to get into another category, unless you just feel like competing with heavier people
06.11.2025, 21:44 - Sopot - Meet Director: Of course it can.
06.11.2025, 21:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: Eventually we will reach to this stage of evolution of the sport
06.11.2025, 21:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: Separate weight categories and separate men and women
06.11.2025, 21:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: But not now
06.11.2025, 22:12 - +351 918 194 767: because In loads of competitions you'll have one category with 2 or 3 pilots, like it already happens with the woman's category.
06.11.2025, 22:15 - +351 965 866 874: Initially, yes, but with time and with manufacturers producing better wings for lighter weight classes, I think this would undergo a positive change, allowing pilots to compete safely within their weight class. I believe it should start with CAT2 races and then evolve to CAT1.
06.11.2025, 22:53 - +351 965 866 874: Julien, please check the information you provided in the presentation, regarding point 8.3.4 Ballast, of the Section 7 XC-2022 document, because that point refers to hang gliders. Point 8.5.4 refers to paragliders, and it is the same as the current document (2025). In 2022 there was no weight limitation.
Also, the interpretation that only sand or water ballast can be used is, in my opinion, incorrect. What is written there is that JETTISONABLE ballast can only be sand or water, it does not limit the use of other types of ballast that are not jettisonable - lead jackets.

06.11.2025, 23:44 - +351 965 866 874: I still believe that of the 3 proposed systems, the Weight Classes system is the fairest, as it allows pilots to compete on an equal footing.
In the MRT, as already mentioned, the positioning of the turning points with different radii will benefit those who will be close to the service thermal, or close to the slope...
Regarding the equalizers, as also already mentioned, it doesn't make sense for pilots to invest in increasingly aerodynamic equipment only to then add drag.
So the Weight Class system is the worst of all, if we remove all the others!  😁
06.11.2025, 23:53 - Julien Garcia: Thanks for the correction @⁨~Paulo Herculano⁩. I'll update the doc accordingly. About Ballast nature I'm still unsure.
06.11.2025, 23:53 - Julien Garcia: https://gagglereport.org/pilots/weight-data
06.11.2025, 23:54 - Julien Garcia: Here are some first datas from our Users profiles. I won't draft conclusion myself, but I believe there are tendencies that are shown.
06.11.2025, 23:55 - +351 965 866 874: Otherwise, all the pilots who competed in PWC and CAT1 wearing lead vests were illegal and should have been sanctioned. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
06.11.2025, 23:56 - Julien Garcia: Of course now the rule is out... Nothing like this apply.
06.11.2025, 23:57 - Julien Garcia: But back in the past, these things were forbidden. Sand and water only.
06.11.2025, 23:57 - +351 965 866 874: Is out since 2019
06.11.2025, 23:58 - Julien Garcia: Checking
06.11.2025, 23:58 - Julien Garcia: For the PWC 2019 correct
