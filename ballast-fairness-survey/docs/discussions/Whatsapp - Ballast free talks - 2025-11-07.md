07.11.2025, 00:01 - Julien Garcia: You were right about my mistake. In 2022 for paragliders : 

8.5.4 Ballast
Pilots must comply with the weight limitations set by the glider airworthiness standards. Weight can be measured at
take-off or landing at the request of the organisers. Pilots may carry jettisonable ballast only in the form of fine sand 
or water. A pilot must avoid dropping ballast at any time or in a manner likely to affect other competing gliders or 
third parties.
07.11.2025, 00:02 - Julien Garcia: No limit but... Sand and water
07.11.2025, 00:03 - Julien Garcia: Ta wiadomość została usunięta
07.11.2025, 00:06 - Julien Garcia: In 2020 exactly for CAT1
07.11.2025, 00:06 - Julien Garcia: 8.3.4 Ballast
Pilots must comply with the weight limitations set by the glider airworthiness standards.
The pilot’s weight is defined as body weight when dressed in jeans, shirt and underwear.
Weight can be measured at take-off or landing at the request of the organisers.
Pilots may carry jettisonable ballast only in the form of fine sand or water. A pilot must avoid dropping ballast at any 
time or in a manner likely to affect other competing gliders or third parties. 
The weight limit for all equipment (without glider), extra clothes and ballast is 25 kg. If a pilot is equipped with a 
second parachute, the weight limit is 28 kg. 
The organiser will provide a weight measurement scale. Pilots’ nominal weight may be checked at registration. Pilots 
may be weighted before taking-off or after landing.

07.11.2025, 00:06 - Julien Garcia: Thanks for correcting
07.11.2025, 00:07 - +351 965 866 874: Sorry to correct again: is not 8.3.4 is 8.5.4. please check
07.11.2025, 00:07 - +33 7 86 12 62 36: One point to consider around the ballast discussions is about applicability in the current cat.1 XC format associating individual podium and Teams podium. 
If solutions might be easy to apply for individual, shouldn’t we pay also attention to the issues related to building a team in a fair way (if the format remains to associate both) ? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 00:12 - Julien Garcia: You are right again. I updated the doc. With 8.5.4 from... 2018
07.11.2025, 00:13 - Julien Garcia: Also worth considering CAT1 allowed an exception limit to reach 95 KG. This is important.
07.11.2025, 00:13 - +351 965 866 874: Only water or sand can be discarded in a jettionable manner. But, by saying this, it opens up the possibility of various forms of ballast not jettionable, since pilots no longer need to be weighed down solely by jeans, a shirt, and underwear. This is why lead vests became possible.
07.11.2025, 00:14 - Julien Garcia: You read it as you can drop sand and water but not lead ?
07.11.2025, 00:14 - +351 965 866 874: Thats the idea
07.11.2025, 00:16 - Julien Garcia: Understood. So there may be weight checks at landings but you are allowed to drop the ballast before being checked ? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 00:17 - +351 965 866 874: As we all know since ever
07.11.2025, 00:18 - +351 965 866 874: Thats way all checks should be done at takeoff

07.11.2025, 00:21 - +386 31 404 688: 'fine' sand or water
07.11.2025, 00:22 - +49 177 4367477: Well maybe fine lead is appropriate 😂
07.11.2025, 00:34 - +49 177 4367477: Seriously this shouldn't be considered because of environmental impact. In Germany tires are not balanced with lead any more because of that!

07.11.2025, 10:41 - +33 6 41 96 06 33: Repeating my message on the right channel (my bad) =>

Hi, i’ve missed some of the talks but I’ll add a last small piece.
I’m one of the « kind of light but heavy enough to fly S or even M wings pilot» (68-70kg). 
If weight categories separate pilots and ranking in high level competitions (National events and PWCs), I will stop flying them. It’s already hard enough to have a high quality of pilots in « small » PWCs and national events (Even the german, english and french ones…). It doesn’t make sense to dilute pilot quality even further.
I’m sure a lot of pilots who are in the top 100/200 of the WPRS will have the same opinion.
07.11.2025, 10:41 - +43 650 4906044: exactly
07.11.2025, 10:45 - +33 6 89 93 36 22: Same
07.11.2025, 10:45 - +33 6 41 96 06 33: Yet we’re one of the only sports where we can try to equalize things a bit. If we can bring most people one size down this will already be a big win. And this could be done on top of adding weight categories. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 10:50 - +39 339 604 2016: Why not force manufacturers to offer 2 or 3 more sizes? Of CCC <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 10:51 - +43 650 4906044: can they?
07.11.2025, 10:53 - Sopot - Meet Director: How are the things in HG:
Their equipment is twice heavier than ours and they don't want to carry ballast. If they have to - they use watter. No one is buying bigger glider than necessary.
07.11.2025, 10:56 - +43 650 4906044: interesting
07.11.2025, 10:57 - +34 615 39 61 88: It doesn't make any sence to say that when most world champions are pilots that are ballasting up just for flying with a big glider, if most competition winners would be heavi pilots that don't need to carry ballast then it would be a sport for heavy people, but righ now it is just working in a way that forces the best pilots to carry an huge amount of extra weight just to fly bigger gliders. I would like to see how it goes with MRT or equalizers, probably the same pilots will be in the top 10 of the competitions without ballast
07.11.2025, 10:57 - +49 1573 4866279: But compared to PG in HG the wingload isn't as important as they don't have as big of a  stability or top speed problem at lower loadings
07.11.2025, 11:00 - +43 650 4906044: what about scoring change somehow in a way to make it fair ...?
07.11.2025, 11:00 - +33 7 67 76 25 90: Lots of HG fly the bigger gliders...
07.11.2025, 11:02 - +33 6 89 93 36 22: What I see is that basically L sizes pilots (or more) are complaining about thermaling against S sizes, that can turn better and everything, blablabla. 

If we don't even take into account that Luc's equalizers solution is leaving a little advantage to bigger sizes to somehow acknowledge this, we basically have the tendancy to forget that we fly mostly in big gaggles, in flatland/mixed terrains, where turn radius is not a hot point in the overall performance.
I looked into my personal datas like turns/min, or my positioning in gaggles. And the result is you don't need the tightest turns to be efficient. 

To have flown S and M, we also forget that stability at high speeds is also increased in bigger sizes.
So maybe we first try to be honest, and not inventing false problems <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 11:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: Maybe they choose the size up, but not two sizes up
07.11.2025, 11:04 - +49 1573 4866279: because there are only three sizes, not five
07.11.2025, 11:04 - +49 176 99664687: Unfortunately you have no real name on your profile so I have no idea who you are. Since when are you around?
Scoring depending on weight does not work and was discussed many times before. 


Weight classes split the community and reduce the pool of skilled pilots. This may kill the sport. 

As physics don’t change, equalizing the heavier ones down looks like the most realistic approach. (Today) <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 11:04 - Sopot - Meet Director: No, HG sizes are for optimim loading every 10 kg
07.11.2025, 11:05 - +33 6 83 16 16 76: Same of course !
07.11.2025, 11:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: They don't have min, max like we have
07.11.2025, 11:07 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: And if pilots are still worried about fairness with equalizers, lets not forget that the system is not rigid, a lot of fine tunning can be done.
07.11.2025, 11:08 - +43 650 4906044: my name is chris chionidis i fly 12 years and i am not so well educated about all this but is really interesting... excuse me if i made a stupid question because of poor knowlegde.. i just try to say my opinion....
07.11.2025, 11:15 - +43 650 4906044: i flew some. competitions... and i only like it to learn stuff.... like gaggling and completing tasks... learning every detail.... but i am not so competative person.... and also when 1 time i tried.... i was third with my 85... against amazing pilots.... ftom the alpine club golden eagles... which i am a member... i didnt felt any disadvantage.... i was just fast and focused..  so my opinion maybe doesnt matter.... because i see a lot of people that know what they talk about.. here and i hope the best for .. ✌️🫶🪂

07.11.2025, 16:58 - +386 31 606 148: ❓️Im asking... what is suddenly the problem with ballast??
I think its just imaginary problem, or at least not the real one! (Yes, its not ideal to have a lot of ballast. But if the pilot decide for that way, leave it. 
‼️As mentioned, there are additional problems with WORSE STABILITY, e.g. safety in flying, etc.. not just worse performance. So what favor will be made, if someone might take off a bit easer, but have more problems in the air...and crash..??)
❓️Do we have a statistic, how many accidents, happen due to too much ballast!?? (And what is too much? One can be stonger/fitt and carry 10kg, than other.. so..)
❓️And we are trying to "solve" something with ballast, because is the "easiest" thing to point on. But noving away from real issue!
Another thing. There are comments, how it was done in the past, when weighing pilots.. and ridiculous ballast hiding, etc..
And what will you gain, if the balast limit will be enforced again!?? 
That is not the "solution"!! Wake up!

✔️LEAVE THE BALALST OPEN, like it was now. Everyone will decide what is in their power.
With reinforcement balast limit, you are prohibiting ligher pilots to have "equal" chances to others!

‼️The real improvements and regulations should be done here:
Why pushing competitons in sketchy places??
Why pushing competitions in sketchy weather, etc..
Cancelling/stopping the task, soon enough.
Those are the real and FUNDAMENTAL topic to solve.

When and IF, the smaller gliders will become closer in performances, safer and more user friendly to bigger, then pilots will switch by themselves. Its up to us/them. The market will sort out by itself.
Manufacturers already have options to make them bette and put more R&D in to it.
And yes, in that cse, if it helps, remove the speed limiter, e.g. increase it, so that profiles/gliders can evolve.

❎️Do not reinforce the ballast limit!
07.11.2025, 17:04 - +1 (510) 299-3701: What’s your name?
07.11.2025, 17:06 - +44 7446 445157: _"In summary, the CIVL Bureau does not believe that re-introducing the ballast limit by itself is the best way forward. We simply believe that it is better than ignoring the clear safety issue associated with pilots carrying excessive ballast."_ 

It would seem that a ballast limit is imminent which will penalise light pilots.  That includes the majority of our recent World champions, it would be a bad situation if Max, Baptiste, Hono, etc were handicapped.

Perhaps we ask those *top pilots* who will be *affected* to *rank* the solutions being discussed. 

They are the ones who have most to lose by the changes, the rest of us just need to accept it's for the overall benefit of our sport.

07.11.2025, 17:21 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Because if you choose a small enough number I’d agree. At some weight range the numbers aren’t there to support development of good XXS or whatever gliders. But without trying something like equalizers we won’t have an undistorted view of what is possible/practical.

And for the vast majority of competitors, your statement doesn’t apply. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 17:24 - Sopot - Meet Director: Light people in the PG context are below 80 kg body weight

07.11.2025, 17:26 - Julien Garcia: Hi Dusan, many things on your message I could agree on. Still, the ballast use is an actual issue. Please have a look at the datas : https://gagglereport.org/ballast/issue <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>

07.11.2025, 17:34 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Sure, there is a combination of enjoyment and hassle and risk. But much of the point of regulation is to tip the balance toward the positive aspects.

I’d agree it’s hard to make positive change. But you definitely can’t do it if you don’t believe it’s possible.
07.11.2025, 17:36 - Sopot - Meet Director: Positive change is possible. What is not possible is to make the sport equally suitable for all people on the planet
07.11.2025, 17:36 - +44 7815 693738: In fact the whole point of this group isn’t about it being fun or fair, but being safer!
07.11.2025, 17:37 - Sopot - Meet Director: Yes, to make it safer is also possible
07.11.2025, 17:37 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Is it <80kg or all people on the planet?

You’re either being hyperbolic or moving the goalposts in a motte and bailey sort of way.
07.11.2025, 17:38 - +44 7815 693738: It really is, weight ranges do that, its just not popular to some people. But it would make it equally suitable for all people.
07.11.2025, 17:38 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: current champions have often been 65 kg body weight + 45kg bags. What is the arm that they could still be champion with a normal weight bag ?
07.11.2025, 17:39 - +1 (510) 299-3701: The motte-and-bailey fallacy is a form of argument and an informal fallacy where an arguer conflates two positions that share similarities: one modest and easy to defend (the "motte") and one much more controversial and harder to defend (the "bailey”). The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, insists that only the more modest position is being advanced. Upon retreating to the motte, the arguer may claim that the bailey has not been refuted (because the critic refused to attack the motte) or that the critic is unreasonable (by equating an attack on the bailey with an attack on the motte).
07.11.2025, 17:39 - Sopot - Meet Director: Weight ranges are indeed the best way forward, but the problem with small gliders being more nervous will not be solved

07.11.2025, 17:49 - Sopot - Meet Director: The fairness will be harmed, the sporting spirit will be harmed
07.11.2025, 17:49 - +33 6 83 16 16 76: Is it a problem ? Smaller wing are more nervous, maybe we will have to increase in skill ?

07.11.2025, 17:57 - +44 7815 693738: I understand your frustration as the equaliser would affect the heavy pilots the most, which I imagine you are one of them, but the majority of pilots are “light” as you put it. So what do you suggest we do that is fair to you and them?
07.11.2025, 17:57 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: OK. In the same competition, Maxime Pinot compete with a bag of 45kg (and a Enzo3 M) against his twin brother with a bag of 15kg (and a Enzo3 XS). They have the same performance and same chance of winning thanks to the Equalizers. Where is the unfairness ?
07.11.2025, 18:00 - +39 339 604 2016: Hi guys, maybe because M size floats bedder and is more stable on speed?

That's why one of the twins is going to the gym, becomes stronger and is able to fly the better glider size. The other twin is lazy, cannot carry 40 kg of ballast and has no other choice but to fly size XS

07.11.2025, 18:06 - +1 (510) 299-3701: paragliding is currently encouraging eating disorders, though in the other direction.
07.11.2025, 18:07 - +44 7815 693738: I think the fact that the smaller Enzo 3’s aren’t as polished as the bigger ones has really confused this topic. They don’t have the same preformance, and never will, but it doesn’t mean they can’t be just as nice to fly (Luc correct me if I’m wrong).

07.11.2025, 18:12 - +41 76 465 96 05: Why? The current situation suggests becoming 65 kg and carrying 45 kg gear.

Could also be the other way around, one twin would like to keep his BMI in the normal range because it benefits his other passions (e.g. Hike and Fly) and also would like to keep the additional Ballast to a minimum becase he values his health and wants a healthy skeleton when hes older. The other one gives in to "high performance" and gains weight by eating a lot of junk food😬

07.11.2025, 18:24 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I’m in favor of hitting the gym and putting on some muscle but if you’re serious about it to go up a glider size (or more) you have to either be young and very dedicated or take steroids. That is definitely considered unfair in some other sports.
07.11.2025, 18:25 - +33 6 83 16 16 76: Size S is not an untamable horse! I used 3 of them without any problem. So there is no security problem with the size.

I just switched to size M to try on a competition. Sure that in the current state of things there is a difference that I find noticeable (and in thermal this size M turns very well with some steering adaptations) in terms of performance. 

I will move to size M because I have no choice to be more competitive. But let’s be honest, let’s look at the quality of our takeoffs and landings. With ballast, we are not as good. There is a security problem.


Another question arises in addition to the ballast, it is the level of piloting by pilots including in PWC. How long did it take 10 years to get out of a cravate, a spin and recently spirals? Not to mention some takeoffs and landings. It’s another question that may not belong here (sorry @⁨Julien Garcia⁩ ) but in my opinion, it is an important subject. My hypothesis?  The wings are progressing they collapses less, the discipline is more democratized and made more accessible but a wing can collapse anyway and when it does, you need a battery of well-automated gestures to get through it quickly, under stress, surrounded by other pilots, etc.


To situate myself, 68 kg, I have been flying since 2001, I am a instructor, test pilot for 15 years for 6 years in PWC and I experienced the time of non-homologated wings in competition.
07.11.2025, 18:25 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: This affirmation is not only a phallacy but a totally gross and ridicule exaggeration ... your are being ideological ... ok you do not like them ... but just say it clearly ... with no false afirmations
07.11.2025, 18:27 - +44 7815 693738: It’s good data from Bruce, so knowing this info: that smaller gliders are affected more by the same size turbulence compared to bigger wings, the smaller sizes would have to be designed differently, trimmed differently etc, to create the same “user experience”. But the result, having a nice glider to fly for the pilot, could be achieved regardless of size, it’s a design problem not a size problem. How much that affects the wing’s performance is another question, but that’s where it’s “usable performance” would then come into play. Again it’s Luc that could make this point clearer because it seems to be brought up a lot as an argument not to have smaller gliders “as no one would fly them anyway because they are not nice to fly”.
07.11.2025, 18:27 - Sopot - Meet Director: From the first announcment of the idea I constantly say that I don't like it ...

07.11.2025, 18:28 - +41 76 465 96 05: Using Luc’s line‑drag and glide‑ratio data for calibration, the model shows that an equalizer solution significantly narrows the performance gap between wing sizes. A practical policy lever is to increase equalizer length for pilots flying with higher ballast, which further improves fairness across sizes while staying within a 135 kg wing cap.

Limitations: this is a quasi‑steady model; it does not capture dynamic effects due to inertia or pilot/wake interactions, and equalizer/lines details are simplified. I’ll publish the code on GitHub to invite discussion and improvements (parameters, datasets, and validation). Contributions and critique are very welcome.
07.11.2025, 18:33 - Julien Garcia: Thanks for the data. I'll have a deeper look and add them to the list.

It should be double-checked. This is just a hobby for me. I’m a mechanical engineer specialized in rubber material models and the simulation of rubber–metal components.
07.11.2025, 18:43 - Julien Garcia: It is important to have double checks on such calculus
07.11.2025, 18:44 - +49 1573 4866279: Interesting Data! But does the size difference in the lower body parts (hip, thigh, shoulder) actually play a role in Submarine type harnesses? As Luc already confirmed the frontal area is the same with all sizes, so the main contributors to extra drag should be the sitting height and arm dimensions? 
Same about the head/face part, how direct does this transate to frontal area when wearing a helmet (in my mind most helmet manufacturers would have one outer mold for all sizes and just adapt the inside foam to the head circumference, but never verified this...)

Maybe I can answear myself after looking through the code👍🏻

07.11.2025, 19:12 - +41 76 465 96 05: Good points. Most of these parameters are configurable in the config.py file. The model isn’t limited to submarine harnesses; it’s meant as a generalized approach. I’ve assumed a 30° sitting (back) angle, a 60° upper‑arm angle (the upper arm rotated 60° forward from rectagual relative to the airflow), 30% head exposure
07.11.2025, 19:17 - +33 6 33 71 78 40: Lots of messages to unpack today!
It's good to discuss and expose ideas and point of view.

- There is a ballast security problem,
It's important to acknowledge it please
- It would be nice to have more metrics on that though, I agree. Like a list of accidents, near miss, potential issues, known problems ...
- Let's try some of the ideas!
I'm a heavy guy in EN-C (125kg+) doing comps as a hobby, doing some SRS.
I tried 2 weightless, including this year edition. Had a lot of fun. And big pleasure to be wing to wing with Bruce (way lighter) !
Sure it was frustrating at some times (ex: after start when turning at first tp where I had to go further), but fairness is more important.
I acknowledge this isn't ideal for pwca level.
- Maybe the handling of the very small size will still need improvement (maybe homothetic building isn't enough), maybe it will stay the same due to physical law.
Whatever let's work towards less ballast.
- Competitions by weight range is probably the best. But is there enough pilots (small sizes) for it? Which comp organizer will voluntarily limit registration by weights? Hard to achieve without quotas... And anyway cause question for the very top level: nobody wants a comp with only Maxime and Hono. Those pilots want to compete in the 'overall' category.
For them the equalizers looks the best.
- In light conditions (which does happen quite a lot, not every day and thermal is bombastic), I feel at disadvantage. But this is also hard to mesure. Maybe why the heaviest are rarely first? Anyway would be nice to think about that too.
07.11.2025, 19:28 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: In very light condition my experience is that advantages in thermalling have to do with wing loading more than with wing size.
In glide nothing changes except less movement for small gliders

07.11.2025, 19:32 - +1 (510) 299-3701: A reason the heaviest are rarely first could just be a matter of the odds of any given pilot or small number of pilots being first is low. 

And just from my personal experience it's clear to me that I'm more at risk in a hard landing with 10kg extra ballast. Except for that time I landed under reserve and popped a 10l water bag...

07.11.2025, 19:47 - Sopot - Meet Director: Josh, the heavy pilots are rarely first because they cannot fit in M or S harness
07.11.2025, 20:00 - +1 (510) 299-3701: So your claim is that there are multiple heavy pilots who would be winning if only they could fit into an M harness?

Is there any way to falsify that hypothesis?

Flying L gliders doesn’t seem to hurt Russ Ogden or William Pardis, both in the top 20 WPRS at the moment. I don’t know size of the others in the top 20 as well. Jouni is a big boy and won a PWC this year.

I’m pretty sure Luc said that the frontal area is the same on all sizes of sub.
07.11.2025, 20:04 - +44 7446 445157: Russ flies medium Enzo.
07.11.2025, 20:07 - +34 692 82 41 02: Im sorry but I fly a big glider and the turn ratio is much bigger, in weak or broken thermals conditions is much difficult to climb
07.11.2025, 20:10 - +1 (510) 299-3701: There are occasional conditions where being able to turn tighter helps but the vast majority of the time in a gaggle you’re reduced to the widest common denominator and can’t use it.

The objective isn’t to make every aspect of different glider sizes exactly the same; it is just to reduce the advantage of the bigger ones enough to remove the incentive to carry dangerous amounts of ballast.
07.11.2025, 20:11 - Sopot - Meet Director: I claim that flying with L harness makes sufficiently more drag to reduce your chances of winning.
07.11.2025, 20:12 - Sopot - Meet Director: The submarines are scaled (zoomed)
07.11.2025, 20:12 - Sopot - Meet Director: I don't know about other brands
07.11.2025, 20:12 - Julien Garcia: Could you share why you would fly an L ?
07.11.2025, 20:13 - +49 1573 4866279: Frontal area is the same, just the L envelope is a bit longer. Was confirmed by Luc
07.11.2025, 20:13 - +34 692 82 41 02: Because I’m too big to fly an M size of the X-one
07.11.2025, 20:14 - Sopot - Meet Director: Let's wait for Luc to clear this question ...
07.11.2025, 20:14 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Though if you really wanted to fly the M you could use a lightweight sub and do it?
07.11.2025, 20:15 - Julien Garcia: I have seen a lot of pilots over-ballasting to reach the next size. Not many doing the opposite to gain avantages in thermals
07.11.2025, 20:15 - Julien Garcia: Altought I aknowledge theses big gliders turn worse.
07.11.2025, 20:15 - +34 692 82 41 02: Probably, but I wouldn’t like to do it honestly. Lightweight harnesses are much more unstable and often uncomfortable too
07.11.2025, 20:16 - +34 692 82 41 02: Sure, that’s completely true, but  it doesn’t come for free, there’s some down sides too
07.11.2025, 20:24 - +39 339 604 2016: The problem are even pilots between the sizes! Too heavy for S and too light for M. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 20:25 - +34 692 82 41 02: That’s my case with the M and the L actually
07.11.2025, 20:25 - +39 339 604 2016: Same but S and M <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 20:27 - +41 76 465 96 05: could you share the source?
07.11.2025, 20:28 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Actually, equalizers should help encourage more sizes, at least in between the popular sizes. Because currently pilots don’t mind carrying ballast because they get some performance advantage out of it at least. But if there is no advantage they’ll be less willing to take on that hassle.

And yes, I’m also between S and M. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 20:30 - +34 692 82 41 02: I don’t think that will happen, sizes are really expensive to develop and certify and this is just a business for the brands in the end
07.11.2025, 20:31 - Sopot - Meet Director: If you certify some small size by CCC - you can make any perfect zoom above from it

07.11.2025, 20:51 - +386 31 404 688: Well. That opens up another issue. 

Imo, manufacturers should be allowed to scale between tested sizes. Ie if 100 & 115kg are both certified, then any sizes between the two should be allowed by scaling, providing line thickness of 115kg are used. 

In CCC this is allowed, but not EN.

Coupled with Equalisers, a pilot could order his perfect size. No ballast needed to get to optimum weight.
07.11.2025, 21:02 - Julien Garcia: Yep I just put the form template.
07.11.2025, 21:02 - Julien Garcia: But... You can already play with the url.

07.11.2025, 21:10 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Unsurprisingly, the mode of the top 100’s bags is 5kg heavier than that for the top 1000. It tips over between top 300 and top 400.

07.11.2025, 21:33 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: I have not flown your glider Marcelo, but all the feedback I got from pilots flying it, suggest it is more a question of brand than of size.

Broken with small punch can favor S ... but overall smooth weak condition depend more on loading

07.11.2025, 22:47 - +41 76 465 96 05: I fixed a bug where the glide ratio was normalized to the 115 kg reference wing with equalizers enabled. Relative comparisons within each group (with vs. without equalizers) were correct, but absolute values were biased. Please pull and use the latest code for validation.

The variables are still open for discussion. In my view, Luc’s suggestion was pretty much spot on, but we should define a rule for pilots who still prefer to fly with more ballast. They should simply use a longer equalizer to prevent any unintended performance imbalance. This way, everyone can tune their personal sweet spot, and we can ensure that pilots retain the maximum freedom of choice.
07.11.2025, 22:51 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Is your suggestion to make the rule that a pilot on e.g. an M glider carrying more than a certain amount of ballast should use an additional length of equalizer beyond what someone on the same glider carrying no (or below the threshold) extra ballast would use? To compensate for their advantage of having, on average, smaller arms, etc.?
07.11.2025, 23:14 - +41 76 465 96 05: Yes
07.11.2025, 23:15 - +1 (510) 299-3701: did you calculate how much more equalizer should be used per extra kg of ballast?
07.11.2025, 23:19 - +41 76 465 96 05: Not yet. I am not yet sure how to optimize it. I will think about how to do it. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
07.11.2025, 23:59 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I wonder about the magnitude because it would be convenient if it was such a 2nd or 3rd order effect that it could be neglected.
