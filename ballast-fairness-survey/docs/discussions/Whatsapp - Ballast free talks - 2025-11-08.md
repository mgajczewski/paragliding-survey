08.11.2025, 00:19 - +41 76 465 96 05: Did you see the graphs? The effect seems to be larger then the difference due to scaling and reynolds. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
08.11.2025, 00:32 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I wonder how realistic that is with sub harnesses, streamlined (perhaps same-sized) helmets and arms held behind risers etc.

Those would all tend to make the overall drag and differences in drag smaller.

But also I’m having a hard time interpreting the graphs.

08.11.2025, 15:12 - +41 76 465 96 05: I’ve updated the model to add equalizer length as ballast increases:

No extra length for gear weight below 25 kg.
A fixed +360 mm for 25–35 kg.
A fixed +705 mm above 35 kg.
This produces very similar polar curves across ballast levels and wing sizes. Pilots can now choose their preferred ballast/size combination.

The approach is still experimental and open to refinement, but it demonstrates that the concept works: adjustable equalizers can remove the incentive to carry excessive ballast for aerodynamic gain and the advantages of big pilots. They may be a practical way to level the playing field. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>

08.11.2025, 15:26 - +41 78 870 02 30: Hi @⁨~L⁩
Thanks for sharing the charts — could you please explain where you obtained the base polars from?

Also, do you have any thoughts on how the approximately 10% flight dynamics disadvantage (e.g. between S and L sizes) could be reflected or adapted in the charts?

As mentioned in this GaggleReport article￼:

“The smaller gliders will lose more altitude than the larger gliders from a given disturbance.”

08.11.2025, 16:52 - +44 7792 446894: Can there be an option to reduce equalisers if using a non-submarine harness for those of us that either can't fit in them or refuse to use the compromised back protection and to accept the discomfort and visibility issues? Then we would be free to compete on equal terms whilst respecting our own safety choices as we are seeking to respect the safety choices of pilots with regard to carrying a lot of ballast. This is a serious question, not a way to generate controversy. 

I, for one, would be way more in favour of equalisers if they allowed me to compete equally on a gen 4 harness with 18cm back protection without penalty. At the moment unless I accept the safety and comfort compromises of a gen 5 harness I cannot realistically compete next year. What would the calcs on this be? 

If adjustments are to be made for ballast and wing size then why not make absolutely everything "fair" and allow older pilots with existing back injuries or those who just refuse to use 6cm of plastic matrix to ensure we don't end up in a wheelchair to also compete fairly on appropriate harnesses without a performance penalty? If wing size and ballast are being equalised, why not safety-related harness choices?

Again this is a genuine inquiry, I'm not seeking to cause arguments. Thanks
08.11.2025, 16:53 - Julien Garcia: Good point Mark. This had been asked countless times as we are numerous to think the same.
08.11.2025, 16:54 - Julien Garcia: There is a FAQ on Equalizers page here : https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers
08.11.2025, 16:55 - Julien Garcia: I'll add the answer provided by @⁨~Luc Armant⁩ here but basically it is stated :
08.11.2025, 16:55 - Julien Garcia: These Equalizers are size equalizers, which are just here to compensate for the performance variation due to physical scale effect between sizes and nothing else. Compensating for differences between brands or models would be another subject. A much more complicated subject. Amongst other huge issues, this would kill any incentive for manufacturers to improve equipment.
08.11.2025, 16:56 - Julien Garcia: Luc had put emphasis on the fact that harness drag is harder to measure and compensate fairly.
08.11.2025, 16:56 - Julien Garcia: It's all I know.
08.11.2025, 16:57 - +358 44 5063309: How about minimum cross section of the harness based on  the wing size?
08.11.2025, 16:57 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: You could also compensate for wing performance and for arm drag, if you wanted to bé complete as it's also a major contributor.
08.11.2025, 16:58 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: But I fear nobody would want to design anything after that.
08.11.2025, 16:59 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: (I mean, no incentive to improve équipment performance)
08.11.2025, 17:06 - +44 7792 446894: Ok. But if there is a general push towards what is being referred to as fairness then why not just have a straightforward handicap for anybody not flying a harness that relies, at least for the forward section, on a difference of air pressure to maintain its in-flight shape, which is a definition that as far as I can see works for all the submarine type harnesses I have so far seen. 

You could allow pilots to chop 30 cm or whatever off The equalisers no matter what size wing they are flying If they cannot or will not fly a Gen 5 harness for safety reasons.. 

Of course those that currently fly submarine harnesses won't like this, but as a person who currently flies an XL glider I don't like the idea of being handicapped either... 

I fail to see the difference fundamentally between the two propositions? It seems to me that one is attempting to equalise wings to remove the incentive to carry a lot of ballast whilst my suggestion seeks to de-incentivise people from using marginal back protection and harnesses which are clearly more difficult to handle, have back-fly problems, are more difficult to deploy a reserve from and have visibility issues. I fail to see any difference fundamentally between the two requests? 

Luc I appreciate what you say but there is no suggestion of equalising between manufacturers or types of wing although I accept the point you make which is that once you start to equalise one thing people will always want to equalise everything. This was why I initially didn't like the idea of equalisers at all. However, as it is a safety issue for many of us, and not a performance issue, I do think it is different fundamentally than an equalisation between brands and different types of glider. Unless I have missed something?
08.11.2025, 17:10 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: The size effect is pretty independant from equipement (brand, etc). That's the big différence with the others performance differences.
08.11.2025, 17:18 - +44 7792 446894: But, sorry to insist, If the goal is to make competitions more fair and safe and it seems to be that we are moving towards some kind of handicapping system for both ballast and wing size then what is the difference between this and having to choose to fly a harness that is compromised on safety for performance and one that has more drag but has much higher passive safety? It seems to me that nobody wants to answer this? If the answer is that manufacturers will never design anything better without the incentive of winning comps I would say that comps should be about who is the best pilot and not who is prepared to fly the most dangerous equipment. For performance there are world records and other feats to perform that will demonstrate that a harness for example is an improvement... I am ok with making comps fair but this has to cut in all directions, not just the ones that suit the current crop of pilots who are winning anyway.
08.11.2025, 17:18 - +49 1522 2444190: Its not that easy. I fly  a lot with a friend who is 2m tall. We have Enzo 3, me M he L and the Gin Race 5 in M and XL. He has no advantage in glide at all
08.11.2025, 17:21 - +41 76 465 96 05: The wing drag is computed using the reference 115 kg wing from Luc Armant’s polar data, and the induced drag is calculated with an assumed Oswald efficiency factor of 0.75.

The base equalizer length is derived from Luc’s formula
(https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers
Tube Length (mm) = (Rounded_Size_Max_Weight − Starting_Wing_Size) × 22, with a starting wing size of 90 kg.

If you want to compensate for the dynamic disadvantage (for which I haven’t seen any documented calculation or estimation), we simply adjust the base-length formula accordingly.
08.11.2025, 17:23 - +44 7792 446894: Well I fly an XL glider and as far as I can see I have no advantage at all either. So either the whole thing is nonsense, or we need to address all safety issues by attempting to equalise out the unfairness or drop it. I don't care which one, but I do think the point is very valid. It's not my fault I have a broken back that I cannot risk a heavy impact on marginal protection any more than it is the fault of a pilot for weighing 50 kilos.  Why should they get a handicap advantage because they have to fly a small glider and I don't because I have to fly a big fat harness? what is the difference?
08.11.2025, 17:25 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Come with a solution, Mark. I don't have one for what you ask.
08.11.2025, 17:29 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: The solution (not inmediate) is "harness standard definition" that takes into account all the concerns Mark and many others have.

I am aware this is already in the process but I am not familiar with details or implementation deadlines.
08.11.2025, 17:40 - Julien Garcia: I believe we face two separate topic too althought I would love to see our harnesses getting better protection. @⁨~Mark Hayman⁩ getting compensated for what you ask, you'll be safer while a light guy will have to carry a low drag harness. I would want ALL to be better equiped <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
08.11.2025, 17:43 - +41 76 465 96 05: How tall are you?
08.11.2025, 17:44 - +49 1522 2444190: 178
08.11.2025, 17:46 - +44 7792 446894: Ok... 

1/ an optimised harness is defined as one that relies on a difference in air pressure to maintain its in-flight shape between the pilots ankles and hip joints. 

2/ a classic harness is one that relies on mechanical pressure exerted by the pilot to maintain its in-flight shape in the same area 

3/ using a medium sized harness as a reference the difference in drag, calculated in Newtons, is to be arrived at and a figure agreed upon which represents the majority of harnesses. 

4/ The speed at which the reference drag is calculated is to be the same as for the proposed equalisers

5/ The polar curves with this difference in drag between classic and optimised harnesses are to be drawn up and a reduction figure, based on this difference is to be removed from the equaliser system that pilots using a classic harness have to carry. 

6/ pilots using optimised harnesses have to carry the full length of equalisers as per the original proposal 

7/ further adjustment of the equaliser length may be required for ballast.

How's that?
08.11.2025, 17:50 - Julien Garcia: And then we adapt each combo to a correct Equalizer size ?
08.11.2025, 17:50 - Julien Garcia: Harness type / Glider size ?
08.11.2025, 17:52 - Julien Garcia: I am only afraid on calculus accuracy for such variety but If it is the consensus we must find to raise approval, I would be in.
08.11.2025, 17:55 - +44 7792 446894: 8/

08.11.2025, 17:56 - +44 7792 446894: 8/ this correction figure between classic and optimised harnesses to be reviewed annually in light of technological advances with either system.
08.11.2025, 17:57 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: There is no such things as classic and optimized harnesses
08.11.2025, 17:57 - +44 7792 446894: Adjust the correction figures then?
08.11.2025, 18:01 - +44 7792 446894: It's not worth getting into the details, that is for clever people like Luc, it was more a philosophical point that if the goal of equalisers is to increase both fairness and safety then I think the argument holds, at least with current harnesses, to apply that logic to people like me who are forced into using a Gen 4 harness and also notions of equality in terms of pilots not being forced into flying the most dangerous equipment, instead being free to choose the safest equipment. The figures can work themselves out in due course. I'm smart with rules, but I'm no aero engineer!
08.11.2025, 18:02 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: No one knows what are the exact amount of drag if the various harnesses on the market
08.11.2025, 18:05 - +49 1522 2444190: Size variation is not exact or linear either. But we could make it a bit fairer for all. Your words

08.11.2025, 18:16 - +1 (724) 984-1982: It seems there is not much discussion regarding increasing harness protection;
Perhaps in the general chat. Given the support for adding drag to make things more fair, thus somewhat abandoning the idea of flying with absolute peak performance, it seems that adding more protection to the harnesses to improve safety is a logical move. I don’t want to purchase a new harness, but i absolutely would if there was a safer option in terms of back protection. How much would a Sub performance drop if it had 20 more cm under seat? It seems like the safety increase to back injury would be massive.
08.11.2025, 18:32 - +44 7815 693738: This group is just for ballast, back protection is definitely a big issue and something I’m sure most in the community want to sort out. But it’s a discussion for a different group.
08.11.2025, 18:35 - +44 7815 693738: @⁨~Luc Armant⁩ can you comment on this issue please. 🙏
08.11.2025, 18:52 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: I think that it is possible to make small competition glider which can be handled as well as bigger ones. At least from 85kg all up. With same wing loading, They will be more nervous, more responsive to turbulences
08.11.2025, 18:52 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: But it's not necessarily bad
08.11.2025, 18:56 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Regarding Bruce's study starting that the smaller sizes have Dynamic performance disadvantage into turbulences, I don't know what to think.
08.11.2025, 18:57 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: If that is true, then we will still see pilots ballasting to take bigger sizes.
08.11.2025, 18:57 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: And it will be possible to increase more the equalizer compensation
08.11.2025, 18:59 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: But without clear figures, I don't think we can justify bigger equalizer compensation at first.
08.11.2025, 19:03 - +44 7792 446894: You are only trying to find a figure which somewhat compensates between the two types of harnesses, it doesn't need to be exact. It could still somewhat favour the submarine types. It's more to allow a freer choice for the pilot than to exactly make things fair. So you don't need an exact figure, just something that is better than zero. I note the comment about this thread being for ballast so I'll stop posting having made my points and asked my questions, I just put this here to round things off. Thank you for responding, perhaps it is a little more food for thought? Cheers, Mark
08.11.2025, 19:17 - Julien Garcia: Several pilots asked the same Mark. No trouble really.
08.11.2025, 20:24 - +1 (724) 984-1982: To this point of getting “closer to fair”.   I think that the goal being this is a better start point than exact fairness as exact fairness may never be found. That being said, I greatly appreciate the talented minds working to equate the multitude of factors in order to find an exact fairness.
