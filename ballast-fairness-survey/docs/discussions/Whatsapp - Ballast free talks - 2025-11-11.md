11.11.2025, 00:45 - +1 (510) 299-3701: In principle I like the idea of letting pilots vote with their feet, but in this case I suspect it would lead to little change.

We already have a lightweight class at many Cat. 2s and it has had hardly any effect on pilots’ ballasting and glider size choices.

Until a solution is on the horizon at a Cat 1, most pilots won’t see it as real.
11.11.2025, 00:47 - +1 (510) 299-3701: There is also a question of how many organizers would want to make their lives more complex by having more classes.

Another way the free market could work is that if equalizers start to catch on, some Cat 2s will require them and others won’t. Pilots who care enough will choose their events accordingly.
11.11.2025, 00:49 - +1 (510) 299-3701: that could lead to de facto weight class competitions if some heavy pilots avoid comps with equalizers.
11.11.2025, 06:53 - +44 7815 693738: That’s assuming that most pilots only do comps to get in to CAT1’s. I don’t think there are 7500 pilots competing for a team place.
11.11.2025, 06:57 - Sopot - Meet Director: If weight categories are introduced in WPRS - they will have immediate adoption through the whole competition scene (Cat1s and Cat2s).
If equalizers are introduced - there will be a long transitional period.
11.11.2025, 06:58 - +44 7815 693738: In the Brits we have; overall, female, sports class, best new comer, Reynolds etc. I don’t think categories increase the workload much, they just add a bit of time to the closing ceremony. Reynolds doesn’t work at the moment because there is still an overall, if you remove that the categories have equal importance.
11.11.2025, 06:59 - +44 7815 693738: Exactly 👍
11.11.2025, 07:25 - +386 31 404 688: Actually, the Reynolds does add quite a bit of work as you need to know the wing size the pilot is flying. Pilots have a habit of putting incorrect data on their forms, often misunderstanding the question about weight, or leaving it blank.

A lot of that stems from either the class not being applicable to them, or their not taking it seriously enough. 

If more events used it, it would become less work.
11.11.2025, 07:26 - +386 31 404 688: That said, it isn't a huge job. Just normal scoring stuff. No different to trying to get their correct wing and harness info etc
11.11.2025, 07:28 - +386 31 404 688: Pilots are lazy. Systems need to be simple. 👻

I'd support Max weight of a wing being printed on a wingtip 🙏
11.11.2025, 09:21 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: All debates here are about forcing changes into Cat1 and WPRS.

No need to debate anything for the 7500 pilots not interested in the highest level, because Cat2 are free to do what they like as they do it right now.

I thought it was clear that creating one or two lightweight classes did not solve the ballast problem at all
11.11.2025, 09:55 - Sopot - Meet Director: Cat2s are significant because they are the main contributor of points for WPRS. If for example there is a lightweight category - the selection for Cat1 Lightweight might be according to Lightweight WPRS ranking ...
11.11.2025, 09:56 - +49 1573 4866279: but cat1 selection is never really according to wprs.
11.11.2025, 09:56 - Sopot - Meet Director: It is
11.11.2025, 09:57 - Sopot - Meet Director: At least the qualification
11.11.2025, 09:57 - Sopot - Meet Director: I know many countries (NACs) do their decision who to send according to pilot's WPRS ranking <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 09:58 - +44 7815 693738: Eduardo than was quite a worrying post. We are not here to force anything. If a proposal is good it is more likely to be accepted. CAT1’s and WPRS are separate issues albeit slightly liked. My document covers more than 1 or 2 weight classes and it covers WPRS, but needs more input on CAT1’s. 

CAT2’s can’t “do what they like”, they have to conform to the current WPRS rules so having categories doesn’t work at the moment. If they want to give out WPRS points they are bound by those rules. If those rules change it will affect the masses. You are saying that you want to force a rule through that will only benefit the top 120 pilots and completely disregard the affect it will have on over 7000 other people? Thats just not morally right, they matter too.
11.11.2025, 10:02 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: That is not at all what I said.
But this is becoming a conversation that makes no sense.
People have a position taken, and hear no arguments
11.11.2025, 10:02 - +49 1573 4866279: but they aren't bound to it. And how would selection through lw WPRS work? another +1 for all teams?
11.11.2025, 10:04 - Sopot - Meet Director: Yes. This topic has to be discussed and decided if the LW category is approved
11.11.2025, 10:05 - +32 486 31 34 36: Also, every top pilot went through the Cat 2’s during his progression at one point of time,  which means if with time, the newcomers will feed the top pilots and if those were playing with these rules from the start, they won’t have any problems with that when they will reach Cat 1. Si to me, having these rules in Cat 2’s is also the way to go
11.11.2025, 10:09 - +44 7815 693738: I am trying to encourage input, to bring detailed solutions, not just opinions.

Maybe there are misuderstandings.
11.11.2025, 10:40 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: The vast majority of the 7500 pilots you mention DO NOT fly CCC gliders.

But weight classes are irrespective of glider classes
11.11.2025, 10:41 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: So a EN-B or EN-C  pilot will compete in the same weight class than a serial or CCC glider? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 10:42 - Sopot - Meet Director: And he will have a choice: fly in his weight category or carry ballast and fly in Overal category
11.11.2025, 10:44 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: But then you want weight classes to give medals, not to solve ballast problems
11.11.2025, 10:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: Yes - the medals will solve the ballast problem
11.11.2025, 10:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: This is what I expect
11.11.2025, 10:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: Of course ther will be people choosing to carry ballast
11.11.2025, 10:46 - Sopot - Meet Director: But at least they will have the option to skip the ballast
11.11.2025, 10:46 - Sopot - Meet Director: Now they don't have this option
11.11.2025, 10:48 - +386 31 404 688: There seems to be two threads running concurrently here. One to solve ballast at CAT1 by giving medals, and one to solve all events by controlling the WPRS.

They are very different things.

Maybe this group needs splitting into two?
11.11.2025, 10:50 - Sopot - Meet Director: Two sides of the same coin
11.11.2025, 10:51 - +44 7815 693738: For me it’s to solve the ballast issue for everyone. Ballasting in CAT2’s is still a problem. In my opinion the only way that categories will work is if WPRS change to award multiple winners. So the two are the same.
11.11.2025, 10:54 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: @⁨Sopot - Meet Director⁩ : how many weight category would you now like in your plan ?
11.11.2025, 10:54 - Sopot - Meet Director: Malin, I hope that you are aware that you cannot impose things on Cat2s. You can only create incentives
11.11.2025, 10:54 - Sopot - Meet Director: Only one for now
11.11.2025, 10:55 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: you mean two ?
11.11.2025, 10:55 - +44 7815 693738: I think this is where our thoughts differ. I don’t think categories work if you still have an overall winner, and WPRS stays the same. That’s why I think overall comps and multi winner ones should be separate. Then everyone is happy.
11.11.2025, 10:55 - +386 31 404 688: But they are not the same.

We have Junior category in WPRS, but we do not have Junior medal at CAT1.

Soon we will have Sports category in WPRS. But we do have them in CAT1.

The exception to the above two is there is a specific Junior Worlds, and soon there may be a Sports worlds.

So if you are looking to changing WPRS, that is one thing. But CAT1 is completely different and a separate proposal and approach. You do not need to change WPRS for a 'class' in CAT1 just as you don't need to change CAT1 to change WPRS. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 10:55 - Sopot - Meet Director: Maybe after some years (and if it seems necessary) - another one
11.11.2025, 10:56 - +386 31 404 688: Just to outline the current WPRS process.

The only existing rules in CIVL for WPRS is that:
♦ a ranking order for the event must be submitted. The order they finished 1st to last. The points they achieve in the event are irrelevant. Just their position counts.
♦ The results must identify CIVL number, Nationality (by Sporting licence), sex, glider and if they hold a valid sporting licence.
♦ The organiser must upload IGC tracks and incident reports.

That is pretty much it.

The system will then process all that info and create the WPRS ranking based on the formula in Section 7e. It is a single calculation for a single score.

The process does not care about classes within the event. They are not uploaded into the final results. They are for local use only. It is entirely optional for the organiser if he wants classes or not, and what those classes are. Even they Sports class results will not be uploaded to the WPRS as the system will already be able to identify the class of a glider from the glider model. Weight is a whole new dimension not presently in the system at all.

Things like Junior & Female rankings in WPRS are just selector buttons to filter out the other pilots. The new Sports ranking will use the same filter technique.

So to have weight as part of the WPRS equation it would require a new filter and a way of identifying the pilots that comply with the filter, The existing Sports filter has taken nearly 2 years from proposal to implementation. 

You could just keep the LW class local to the comp, so at a CAT1, the organiser just collects the data at the event registration, the same as CAT2 does it. No pre-selection required.

Currently a CAT1 only identifies the top overall and top female. Juniors, despite being a part of WPRS they are not identified at a CAT1. Nor will the top sports pilot be.

Hopefully that helps you identify what parts of the system would need change for any new proposals.
11.11.2025, 10:58 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: So I suppose you mean, one light weight category and one heavy weight category. How do you deal with people ballasting up to the top of the light weight category ?
11.11.2025, 10:59 - +44 7815 693738: That’s why I said in my document that CAT1’s wasn’t the most pressing issue, but I might have been wrong if people think that it is pilots main motivation for doing comps.
11.11.2025, 11:01 - Sopot - Meet Director: Malin, you are correct about the need to separate the groups. But if we go this way - we have to do it first with men/women and then with lightweight/heavyweight
11.11.2025, 11:02 - +44 7815 693738: Men and women are already split. That can stay unchanged.
11.11.2025, 11:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: Luc, light pilots will do it anyway because they don't like how smallest gliders fly (handlingwise)
11.11.2025, 11:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: Absolutely not
11.11.2025, 11:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: There is Overall and Female
11.11.2025, 11:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: A woman can get 2 medals
11.11.2025, 11:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: A man cannot get 2 medals regardless of how good he is
11.11.2025, 11:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: So this means that now women have more opportunities than men.
11.11.2025, 11:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: But we are Ok with this
11.11.2025, 11:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: It's acceptable
11.11.2025, 11:13 - +386 31 404 688: I don't know if it is acceptable. But we accept it 😊
11.11.2025, 11:14 - Sopot - Meet Director: I personally am Ok if, let's say we have a LW category, and a small chinese girl wins a competition - she goes home with 3 medals
11.11.2025, 11:14 - +44 7815 693738: What are you suggesting then?
11.11.2025, 11:16 - Sopot - Meet Director: I don't think we have reached the stage of the development to separate women from men <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 11:16 - Sopot - Meet Director: Maybe in the distant future...

11.11.2025, 11:32 - +44 7446 445157: Is it possible to analyse the weight data we have to see how the ballast issue exists across glider classes and comp categories.

My perception is that 'the ballast issue' is narrowly contained to those pilots currently (& aspiring to) flying CCCs in Cat 1s.  I cannot think of any EN-C and below pilots that significantly ballast up.

Why is this relevant?  If the data supports the hypothesis, the ballast issue has to solved for Cat1s first and foremost.
11.11.2025, 11:38 - +44 7815 693738: If you only fly in CAT1’s you would do 1 comp a year 😜
11.11.2025, 11:40 - +44 7815 693738: The rest of the time we fly CAT2’s so yes it might just be the higher level pilots but the arena that it’s happening in the most is CAT2 comps.
11.11.2025, 11:41 - +44 7446 445157: Good point. 

But my point is that it is the _pilots_ who do or aspire to Cat 1s that carry the ballast.
11.11.2025, 11:45 - +44 7815 693738: @⁨~Brett Janaway (Si)⁩ would be able to say what ballasting is like in the SRS.
11.11.2025, 12:13 - +49 1522 2444190: The question is: Would people buy smaller wings and skip ballast if we introduce Equalizers, or new podiums if the wings are the same. Because we heard that they can develope nice small wings before. 
It's a bit like buying smaller trousers before loosing weight. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 12:16 - Sopot - Meet Director: I don't see what the designers could possibly do to make them nicer...
11.11.2025, 12:17 - Sopot - Meet Director: If there is something - it would be done already
11.11.2025, 12:26 - +386 31 404 688: In SRS I can only guess.

I do not believe it is not a problem. We do not have ballast complaints or mumbling in chat groups. We do not see pilots carrying excessive ballast. For sure, there are a few lightweight pilots carrying more.

Using my wife as an example. She flies EN-C to CCC wings. She is lucky to be able to compete at up to 15 events a year of all levels.

- SRS, EN-C wing, typically 1-2kg ballast
- In an Open, EN-D wing, typically 5-14kg ballast
- On a high Open, CCC wing, 22kg ballast

But if she is a typical lightweight pilot I don't know.
11.11.2025, 12:27 - +386 31 404 688: There would be many factors for why this happens. It is not simple.
11.11.2025, 12:35 - +44 7815 693738: I don’t think this is true, at the moment there is no incentive to make them better because no one buys them because they all ballast up. Secondly, if you try and make a smaller wing try and keep up with a bigger wing, more focus will be put on performance at the detriment to handling. If you are making a wing that is only being compared to other wings of its size, usable performance is a much more important factor. Remember just because it always was, doesn’t mean it’s what it always has to be.
11.11.2025, 12:38 - Sopot - Meet Director: Ok, what you say is possible. Then the only incentive for nicer XXS gliders will be if they have their own weight category and medals.
11.11.2025, 12:39 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Or Equalizer
11.11.2025, 12:39 - +1 (284) 541-0307: More categories does make more podiums.  I've never found someone unhappy to be on a podium
11.11.2025, 12:41 - Sopot - Meet Director: Equalizers won't do the trick. People will prefer some small amount of ballast, but better handling
11.11.2025, 12:41 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: You could say exactly the same for weight class !
11.11.2025, 12:44 - +44 7815 693738: Equalisers and weight categories, and for Luc to make a nice XXS Enzo 4 😉
11.11.2025, 12:46 - +36 30 500 2958: Weight categories as I understand have been discussed for ages. The agreement is that they cannot be real categories as long as pilots race together.
In boxing, you have a separate match for each weight category. In our sport, it'd only be possible if we'd make 5 different tasks on the same day for 5 different categories.
We cannot even design one task safely, I believe no one expects any organizer to design and monitor 5 tasks in parallel. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 12:46 - +49 1522 2444190: Luc said enzo 3xxs is already better than enzo2. But nobody wants to give it a chance. Why would that change. 
Would you jump on a S right away if we introduce Equalizers @⁨~Maxime Pinot⁩ ?
11.11.2025, 12:47 - +44 7815 693738: Why would you need different tasks?
11.11.2025, 12:48 - +36 30 500 2958: Because how can you separate categories if people fly together? An S sized pilot joins an M sized gaggle, flies the task, makes the goal, without making any independent decision. Is he really the champion of his category?
11.11.2025, 12:49 - +36 30 500 2958: that pilot will have a crazy amount of leading points in their own category
11.11.2025, 12:50 - Sopot - Meet Director: In the current competition format (all pilots fly together) the light people and women has enormous benefits ...
11.11.2025, 12:51 - Sopot - Meet Director: It must stay like that
11.11.2025, 12:51 - +44 7815 693738: But every S size pilot could be in that gaggle so it would be fair. If he could keep up with all of the M gliders we wouldn’t be having this discussion.
11.11.2025, 12:51 - +44 7815 693738: How?
11.11.2025, 12:51 - +36 30 500 2958: Why is it that only L sized pilots say this?
11.11.2025, 12:52 - +36 30 500 2958: Have you talked with a female pilot about their enormous benefits?
11.11.2025, 12:52 - Sopot - Meet Director: They enjoy more, they get good WPRS points, etc.
11.11.2025, 12:54 - +33 6 89 93 36 22: Sure.
For me, Luc's solution try to bring fairness so we can still compete altogether, and can compare skills. 

In the contrary, I don't like at all weight categories because of the same state of mind: I want maximum elite pilots to compare true skills.
When we talk about weight categories, my opinion is that we think in term of hobby, not elite sport.
11.11.2025, 12:54 - Sopot - Meet Director: No, I haven't,  but I can see what was the participation of the Women Championships and what is the perspective to have another one
11.11.2025, 12:57 - +36 30 500 2958: I think it depends on the number of athletes as well. If we'd have hundreds of pilots on your level, it'd make sense to make separate championships in weight categories.
Currently it does not.
11.11.2025, 12:59 - +33 6 89 93 36 22: Ta wiadomość została usunięta
11.11.2025, 13:01 - +43 664 75129998: I see no problem with everybody flying together IF there were categories. 

But it is clearer than day by now that the least impactful, least controversial and fastest to implement solution is the equilazer. There is no other quick solution to this problem, period.
11.11.2025, 13:02 - +43 664 75129998: Drag is calculated by computer, no changes to the current rules.
11.11.2025, 13:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: Equalizers have the potential to be very impactful
11.11.2025, 13:06 - +43 664 75129998: Sure then let’s keep arguing over something so controversial that will have no solution in years. Instead we should test , adjust and implement a solution that is ready today. Then we can see how it goes.
11.11.2025, 13:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: Testing is the key
11.11.2025, 13:07 - +43 664 75129998: I bet that pilots will not notice the difference and here we are arguing and not moving an inch forward
11.11.2025, 13:07 - Sopot - Meet Director: As a software developer I'm keen to implement all kind of crazy ideas only to be tested ...
11.11.2025, 13:08 - +36 30 500 2958: Trail running is actually not an inclusive sport, show me a trail runner over 100 kg. We can do much better then that with equalizers. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 13:08 - +44 7815 693738: Pal I think that’s only if they are proven to be effective. Chicken and egg. No one is going to step down a size and then throw away a comp season on a smaller glider before they are sure they work. Some big pilots say they would give up the sport if they get introduced, what about them? I don’t want to be part of the reason that people give up this beautiful sport. They need other options as well.
11.11.2025, 13:14 - +43 664 75129998: There is a solution that is available today and the only thing holding it back from implementing is politics and discussions like this. 

MRT is not accepted by high level pilots. There is no way it will be cat1.
Weight classes…I don’t feel it either really…

If there was a cat1 tomorrow you could put on some noodles and have SOME kind of compensation without changing anything else.

If the big pilots will stop flying because of this, well then they really should. I don’t  believe it.
They can always go to CAT2. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 13:15 - +420 737 683 261: I asked already, but didn't receive a proper response from anyone. Sorry if I missed something.
How hard would it be to make CCC 2026 with equalizers "baked in" in the form of thicker lines? Would it be possible to create a formula which would tell us how much thicker lines we should use on each size, scaling from XS or XXS? Is there any downside to that solution that I don't see?
11.11.2025, 13:17 - Sopot - Meet Director: Completely possible
11.11.2025, 13:18 - Sopot - Meet Director: You can propose it
11.11.2025, 13:18 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: We tried to turn to turn this idea in many possible ways, it does not work in practicle. You also have to include EN D wings in the ecosystem, which makes another layer of impossibility
11.11.2025, 13:19 - +43 664 75129998: Man those gliders are not only used in competition…
11.11.2025, 13:20 - +420 737 683 261: I know, but in my point of view it should be used primarily as a competition glider, and we shouldn't care about cross country when designing the class for competing
11.11.2025, 13:21 - +36 30 500 2958: I still think "equalizers" should mean the whole system of adding drag, and noodles should only be one part of the equations. The other parts would be:

* harness
* second line set, like Ondrej proposes
* pilot's arm length
11.11.2025, 13:21 - Sopot - Meet Director: Good luck pushing the EN standard to another competition-optimized direction ...
11.11.2025, 13:21 - +36 30 500 2958: You could buy a different colored lineset and have it counted as "equalizer cm-s".
11.11.2025, 13:22 - Julien Garcia: I feel it is time to vote on each presented solution as they are intended from their contenders.
11.11.2025, 13:22 - Julien Garcia: If someone wish to add a custom solution to the list it should be a spread proposal presented in a visio
11.11.2025, 13:23 - Julien Garcia: I'm open to give this opportunity
11.11.2025, 13:23 - Julien Garcia: It can be size Equalizers in the shape of "more harness" / "more lines"
11.11.2025, 13:24 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Ondrej: do you want me to detail you the various practical issues of your idea ?
11.11.2025, 13:24 - Julien Garcia: Please submit proposals and we will discuss it further.
11.11.2025, 13:24 - +43 664 75129998: Sure and turn change lineset from competition to XC setup back and forth right? Or buy two gliders, right?
11.11.2025, 13:25 - Julien Garcia: I am yet to build the weight category page. @⁨Sopot - Meet Director⁩ and @⁨+44 7815 693738⁩ let's work on this présentation please <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 13:25 - +36 30 500 2958: Pál, many pilots use their gliders 95% on comps only. They have an other set for XC flights.
11.11.2025, 13:25 - +43 664 75129998: Which is he we are not moving forward
11.11.2025, 13:25 - Julien Garcia: Look at https://gagglereport.org/ballast/mrt
11.11.2025, 13:25 - +43 664 75129998: Wrong
11.11.2025, 13:25 - +420 737 683 261: You don't need to. I just wanted to know if you explored this possibility and if yes, and you came to a conclusion that it is not a good solution, I'm ok with it. I have very little expertise in this area
11.11.2025, 13:25 - Julien Garcia: Or https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers
11.11.2025, 13:26 - Julien Garcia: We need the same
11.11.2025, 13:26 - Julien Garcia: We don't have such data. It seems a high rate indeed
11.11.2025, 13:27 - +420 737 683 261: When you buy a race car, do you expect to also go shopping with it? IMO if we want a more professional sport, we should have a professional equipment which shouldn't be weighted down by recreational needs
11.11.2025, 13:27 - +36 30 500 2958: All I'm saying is an _optional_ line-set, with different color. Pilots can make this decision based on their use-case.
11.11.2025, 13:28 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Zsolt, do you want me to details the practical reason why this idea does not work ?
11.11.2025, 13:28 - +36 30 500 2958: yes please
11.11.2025, 13:28 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: it will be done
11.11.2025, 13:29 - Julien Garcia: I'll add it to the FAQ
11.11.2025, 13:29 - +43 664 75129998: I NEVER owned two enzos at the same time and I don’t know of anyone else who did, except an old used one that is impossible to sell. Like some of the ones you are using in hungary Zsolt
11.11.2025, 13:29 - +36 30 500 2958: Pál, this would be an _optional_ choice for pilots, no one is taking anything away from you. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 13:30 - +43 664 75129998: Yeah and spend 5 hours changing lines back and forth with the danger of a possible mistake , OR spending another 4000eur on a second glider. Come on dude….
11.11.2025, 13:34 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: It makes no sense ! Equalisers can be installed and removed easily !
No need to overthink one more time !
2 different set line means —> 2 certifications, double stock, more cost for the pilot … I don’t understand the benefits of having thicker lines knowing that we can add or remove the equalisers in 2 secondes
11.11.2025, 13:38 - +43 664 75129998: Pleeease Zsolt why complicate it more if we can simply put noodles on and off literally in one minute. Arm length helmet size etc etc…is this really what keeps us from a solution? As far as I know Luc left a margin for all of these when calculating the drag: there is LESS drag than it should be!
11.11.2025, 13:39 - +33 6 89 93 36 22: This is called bad faith Pal 😆 <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 13:39 - +36 30 500 2958: I'm not against equalizers, I'm just trying to reduce their length, so that XL pilots don't have to carry 1 meter of noodles, while they have the worst back protection in their harnesses and their lines are the thinnest compared to their total weight.
11.11.2025, 13:39 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: 1- Line drag is not well known and it’s not as simple as referring to their diameter because they are not round. They have a variable geometry and orientation possible for a given line. Nobody could afford to make a very costly wind tunnel study of all the line drag. 
2- There are many line brands, references and colors. Each PG manufacturer is using its own cocktail and has his own way of producing, buying, etc. You cannot force them to buy a specific product to make their glider. 
3- Size compensation cannot be easily adjusted when required. Or when you want to add other subjects like Harness Protection Equalizer.
4- You cannot regulate EN D wings. And these wings are also in CAT1. Actually, many manufacturers are thinking of using the EN D category again for CAT1 top level wings, because of the current issue I have detailed elsewhere.
11.11.2025, 13:40 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: I hope you have enough Zsolt. I can detail even more otherwise.
11.11.2025, 13:41 - +36 30 500 2958: I understand your points Luc. To be clear I wasn't proposing not to use equalizers, I just proposed to make it shorter for those pilots who choose thicker lines.
But maybe it's technically not possible.
11.11.2025, 13:41 - Julien Garcia: We all have a not optimal protection
11.11.2025, 13:41 - Julien Garcia: It is a different problem to adress
11.11.2025, 13:41 - Julien Garcia: Else big guy will be well protected while light guy at risk...
11.11.2025, 13:42 - Julien Garcia: It's not reasonable
11.11.2025, 13:43 - +43 664 75129998: Let’s hope that the voting results that really matter will not allow not qualified pilots to voice their opinion and that we will really have the people‘s opinion with the knowledge to have the right answer. Not some CIVL survey to any registered pilot.
@⁨Julien Garcia⁩  what is your plan for this? We can filter the results by WPRS or something?
11.11.2025, 13:43 - +36 30 500 2958: But we should, Julien! A 100kg pilot would need 1.4x thicker protector compared to a 50kg pilot! With normal materials at least, with Koroyd the lightweight are punished, but let's not go into Koroyd.

Big guys need bigger protectors AND longer noodles. This is not the right direction.
11.11.2025, 13:43 - Julien Garcia: Yes we can and already do
11.11.2025, 13:44 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Zsolt, I mean it's great, I know you since few years now. You have a very inventive mind with plenty of ideas. But my advice is please: try to dig a bit more in term of practicality before advocating them.
11.11.2025, 13:44 - Julien Garcia: For this to work, pilots must update their profile on the website. They are doing it slowly but surely >100
11.11.2025, 13:44 - Julien Garcia: Low ranked pilots opinion is also very interesting for different scope.
11.11.2025, 13:44 - +36 30 500 2958: Luc, we are also in the middle of a safety crisis, pilots are hurting themselves on 6 cm Koroyds. We need to think out of the box if we want safety.
11.11.2025, 13:44 - Julien Garcia: (out of PWC)
11.11.2025, 13:45 - Julien Garcia: Please raise a group for that. We miss one
11.11.2025, 13:45 - Julien Garcia: There are many pilots willing to adjust the current safety harness issue. Let's do it <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 13:46 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: praticality, even out of the box is required.
11.11.2025, 13:46 - +43 664 75129998: Back protection is another topic man. DONT MIX THE TWO!!!
Don’t you see that all this time we should be talking about stuff like that which really matters, especially since it will need 1-2 years to implement while Equalizers are ready today.
11.11.2025, 13:47 - Julien Garcia: It is indeed a good point
11.11.2025, 13:47 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: but it's another subject.
11.11.2025, 13:48 - Julien Garcia: I admit I did not see that. But it is another topic indeed
11.11.2025, 13:48 - +43 664 75129998: I agree
11.11.2025, 13:48 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Equaliser topic and back protection must be addressed separately !
11.11.2025, 13:49 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Let’s stop turning around, don’t mix everything and go ahead with voting !
11.11.2025, 13:49 - +43 664 75129998: <Pominięto multimedia>
11.11.2025, 13:50 - Julien Garcia: I'll rush it today
11.11.2025, 13:56 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Julien, on the voting options we should have a small description of each option under it to avoid having people’s voting one option or the other because they heard from someone it’s not a nice option
11.11.2025, 13:56 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Quick pros and cons
11.11.2025, 13:56 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: If possible
11.11.2025, 14:00 - Julien Garcia: Yep. The page look like this :

11.11.2025, 14:01 - Julien Garcia: Poll
11.11.2025, 14:02 - Julien Garcia: https://gagglereport.org/ballast/mrt <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 14:02 - +90 506 780 46 50: Julian can we define a specific time period for voting and set up the votes hidden until voting ends? So people don’t get influenced by popular votes or hesitate to vote? In open polls where everyone can see who voted for what while the poll is still running, people might hold back if they see their opinion has few supporters. A closed poll with a defined voting window could prevent that
11.11.2025, 14:06 - +39 339 604 2016: Yes, that's true, but perhaps all pilots will accept it more readily once the problem of the protectors is solved? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 14:07 - Julien Garcia: Indeed Dora it can be done within a time frame and without seeing others vote
11.11.2025, 14:08 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Sure i can understand !
But what do you do with tall pilot that are light ? 
He will fly with bigger harness that makes more drag and fly with S size glider ?
11.11.2025, 14:10 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: That’s why we can’t compensate performances of glider performances with harnesses IMO
11.11.2025, 14:10 - +39 339 604 2016: Or with pilots who are between 2 sizes like me?
11.11.2025, 14:11 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Harness protection will be improved but it must be same for everyone as you can mix harnesses and glider sizes. It will not automatically be the same
11.11.2025, 14:13 - +34 692 82 41 02: Well but maybe you could do, if you have an S glider and a L harness you have a shorter equalizer than someone using a M harness, that can be calculated too, no?
11.11.2025, 14:14 - +34 692 82 41 02: If we want to make it fair, then let’s do it, but 100%, not 90% or whatever this system would mean
11.11.2025, 14:14 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: I understand your problem .. but as we said, we need to found the global compromise
We know in advance that we will never cover everything
11.11.2025, 14:15 - +34 692 82 41 02: At least be as close to the 100% fairness as possible
11.11.2025, 14:15 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: So what do you suggest Marcelo ?
11.11.2025, 14:17 - +34 692 82 41 02: Calculate the difference in drag of each size of harnesses, then someone who has a bigger harness will have to use a smaller equaliser, I’m not sure about how much, compared to someone flying same wing size  but with a smaller harness
11.11.2025, 14:17 - +36 30 500 2958: Marcello, that's exactly what I was proposing! Have a table with "bonus cm-s" but people hate me here for that.
11.11.2025, 14:19 - +34 692 82 41 02: If in order to make the sport fairer for small people, we make it more unfair for bigger ones, I don’t think it’s a good approach. I’m in favour of making it fairer, but for everyone, not just for a group of people
11.11.2025, 14:21 - +44 7446 445157: Is it better to have a 90% solution in 6 months than a 99% solution in 2 years ?
11.11.2025, 14:21 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: I think Luc already answered to this question about drag differences in between harness sizes
11.11.2025, 14:21 - +36 30 500 2958: <Pominięto multimedia>
11.11.2025, 14:22 - +34 692 82 41 02: I said 90% just guessing, I don’t know if that’s a true percentage
11.11.2025, 14:22 - +36 30 500 2958: All I'm proposing is something like this. Pilots can exchange noodle length into protector thickness.
11.11.2025, 14:22 - +36 30 500 2958: (totally random values currently of course)
11.11.2025, 14:22 - +34 692 82 41 02: Maybe having a different protector size is not the right way
11.11.2025, 14:22 - +36 30 500 2958: why? why should an XL pilot not have thicker protector?
11.11.2025, 14:23 - +34 692 82 41 02: I think protectors should be good enough for everyone, no?
11.11.2025, 14:24 - +36 30 500 2958: unfortunately, a 2x heavier pilot need about 1.4x thicker protector, or different material
11.11.2025, 14:24 - +34 692 82 41 02: And why do you know it will take 2 years? If it’s just something mathematical I’m sure it can be developed way faster, even before the first test event which as I heard might be in April
11.11.2025, 14:24 - +36 30 500 2958: so a 100kg pilot need 14 cm protector for the same effect as a 50 kg would get on 10 cm
11.11.2025, 14:25 - +34 692 82 41 02: Well, that’s true, but maybe we can all have a 14cm and make it safer for everyone <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 14:26 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: You mean To choose in between these 2 options ?
11.11.2025, 14:27 - +49 160 90321374: I think that trying to balance out the differences between manufacturers and harnesses completely misses the point. The idea behind equalizers is to minimize the risk of ballast flying and to motivate pilots to fly with less ballast.
Making every setup same performant through equalizers takes away the incentive for further development in the sport and also is not fair for the manufacturer. If one of them has the better wing, why should it be dragged to be as bad as the worst competitor?!
11.11.2025, 14:27 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Note that equalisers can be applied directly
New harness and protection need to be developed
11.11.2025, 14:28 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: It doesn’t take 1 month to design
11.11.2025, 14:28 - +36 30 500 2958: I mean a pilot can order a harness with different protectors, _knowing_ that the thick protector can be counted as "noodle cm". Naturally, there'd be no market for L sized guys on thin protectors as they'd just prefer to have the "noodle cm" on their back.
11.11.2025, 14:31 - +34 692 82 41 02: Well maybe I didn’t express myself properly but that’s not what I meant, I’m just trying to say that if we want someone to not have an advantage for being heavy, then we cannot implement a “solution” that will convert that “advantage” into the opposite. Then it won’t be a solution, will just be a change in the rules
11.11.2025, 14:38 - +420 737 683 261: Just maybe one more question in regard to the equalizers. How would it affect the certification of the wings? I'm worried that some insurance companies would argue that we are flying gliders with uncertified changes, which could cause some problems when an accident happens
11.11.2025, 14:39 - Sopot - Meet Director: CCC is an FAI certification - most probably it's not recognized by the insurance companies anyway
11.11.2025, 14:47 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Marcelo, what Luc said several times is that equalizers not really equalize, there is still an advantage for heavier sizes, but that advantage is less. Of course the system cannot be perfect from the start, but it is most probable that XXS, XS and S sizes are not compensated enough
11.11.2025, 14:53 - +41 76 465 96 05: @⁨Julien Garcia⁩ Could you share some information about the current members on GaggleReport? How many are there, and what ranks do they have?
11.11.2025, 14:54 - +41 76 465 96 05: Pls don't rush. It's better to make it properly.
11.11.2025, 15:29 - +33 6 41 96 06 33: Quick reminder, voting will probably be biased because there are (logically) more heavy pilots than light ones.
11.11.2025, 15:47 - Sopot - Meet Director: Quick reminder, voting will probably be biased because there are more light pilots than heavy ones.
11.11.2025, 15:48 - Julien Garcia: Zsolt is proposing a new working group adressing harness size protector. He will try to admin it keeping in mind we could adjust Equalizers later based on the shape / size / cx of the protector. We agreed it was 2 separated steps :
1) Better protector
2) Hopeffuly equalized at some point too
11.11.2025, 15:49 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: I think what Damien wanted to say it that there are more heavy pilot than in the normal population of pilots, as the result of years of avantage for heavy pilots.
11.11.2025, 15:49 - Julien Garcia: 1) is completly independant from ballast and size problem.
2) Is an additional compensation only if Equalizers come to light. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 15:50 - +33 6 41 96 06 33: Yes, thanks.
11.11.2025, 15:51 - Julien Garcia: We can filter the results according to body weight too. For now we don't know. It's important to see where it curently stands
11.11.2025, 15:53 - Julien Garcia: A good way to see this is to go to the weight data
11.11.2025, 15:53 - Julien Garcia: https://gagglereport.org/pilots/weight-data
11.11.2025, 15:54 - Julien Garcia: This can filter the WPRS too only playing with the URL right now
11.11.2025, 15:54 - Julien Garcia: https://gagglereport.org/pilots/weight-data/100
11.11.2025, 15:54 - Julien Garcia: This give you below 100 WPRS
11.11.2025, 15:54 - Sopot - Meet Director: Heavy pilots don't think about the ballast problem - it doesn't exist for them - that's why they will be heavily underrepresented here.
11.11.2025, 15:55 - Julien Garcia: So far it is not the case. 100 pilots registered and updated their profiles
11.11.2025, 15:55 - Julien Garcia: 400+ users on the website. Meaning 300 didn't
11.11.2025, 15:57 - Sopot - Meet Director: From 100 - how many are under 80 kg body weight? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 15:58 - Julien Garcia: 12/16 below 81 Kg
11.11.2025, 15:58 - Julien Garcia: Normal position doesn't weight 80.
11.11.2025, 15:59 - Julien Garcia: Right now what the weight- data suggest is indeed a more than average weighted population.
11.11.2025, 15:59 - Julien Garcia: We need more data
11.11.2025, 15:59 - Julien Garcia: But still...
11.11.2025, 16:00 - Julien Garcia: Our community has a majority over 80Kg which should not be the case in average population.
11.11.2025, 16:00 - Sopot - Meet Director: Ok - what is the body weight for someone to be able to fly M size with reasonable amount of ballast ?
11.11.2025, 16:00 - Julien Garcia: Slightly more représentation of weighted people
11.11.2025, 16:00 - Julien Garcia: That's another question
11.11.2025, 16:00 - Julien Garcia: Look at the graph below
11.11.2025, 16:01 - Julien Garcia: Almost every pilots fly up to 95
11.11.2025, 16:01 - Julien Garcia: Below 60 pilots carry average 38 Kg bags
11.11.2025, 16:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: 38 is far from normal !
11.11.2025, 16:02 - Julien Garcia: They overballast
11.11.2025, 16:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: What is the "normal bag"?
11.11.2025, 16:02 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: 15kg
11.11.2025, 16:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: Mine is 23
11.11.2025, 16:03 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: because manufacturer have not develop light gears for comp
11.11.2025, 16:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: And I don't have anythig which can qualify as "ballast"
11.11.2025, 16:03 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Do you mean normal as in normative or as in common?
11.11.2025, 16:04 - Julien Garcia: Over 80Kg the average bag is still 28 Daniel <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 16:04 - Julien Garcia: I am a newbie in stat. I mean like the other non paragliding typical westerner population <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 16:06 - Julien Garcia: To see a bag droping average at 24 Kg you need to weight over 90.
11.11.2025, 16:08 - Julien Garcia: 23 bags / 96 are below 25 Kg
11.11.2025, 16:08 - Sopot - Meet Director: In this scenario you will be always at the top - what you will do in weak conditions ?!
11.11.2025, 16:08 - Julien Garcia: Daniel it is the data we have. Not a scenario
11.11.2025, 16:09 - Julien Garcia: Some glider are 120 too
11.11.2025, 16:09 - Julien Garcia: Or 125
11.11.2025, 16:09 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I should have been clearer with my attempted clarification. It was directed at the use of “normal” for bag weight.

Normal is confusing because it can refer to two different concepts: what is good and what is common/average.
11.11.2025, 16:10 - Julien Garcia: Indeed. This I don't know. I keep dreaming of 15 kg bag.
11.11.2025, 16:10 - Sopot - Meet Director: I just CANNOT reduce the weight of my bag. I don't even have second reserve.
11.11.2025, 16:10 - +351 960 380 396: Luc this is not realistic.
I carry no ballast at all and my kit is never below ~21kg
11.11.2025, 16:11 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Yes, I mean norma leasure pilot bag having light gears.
11.11.2025, 16:11 - +41 76 465 96 05: What you don't get is that you should fight for less ballast. In relation to the current situation it would benefit you more then the small equalizers.
11.11.2025, 16:12 - Sopot - Meet Director: Luc, you know perfectly well that there is "competition gear" and there is "light gear" and they don't overlap
11.11.2025, 16:12 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: they would in an Equalize world <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 16:16 - Sopot - Meet Director: What will be the incetive to produce light gear ?!? Let's assume they will fly exactly the same - light gear is more comfortable to carry, but less comfortable in the air, less protection, less durable, more expensive ...
11.11.2025, 16:18 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: The same incentive as all leasure pilots have and which brings leasure gears lighter and lighter. Light does not necessarly means less comfortable in the air.
11.11.2025, 16:19 - Sopot - Meet Director: If you can do it - perfect!
11.11.2025, 16:26 - +386 31 404 688: There are key differences between comp gear and leisure gear:

- I have very little choice of competitive wing, so must carry ballast to get to the right wing loading in a competition. In leisure, I choose a brand/model that suits my weight
- in a comp environment I must carry two reserves, not one
- in a comp I need several instruments that I don't need for free flying (tracker/back up/Inreach etc)
- in a comp I need performance. So the wings are heavier and the harnesses are limited in choice
11.11.2025, 16:29 - Michał Adamczuk: Lighter often means less durable. Will a harness weighting not 7-8kg but 3-4kg last just as long?
11.11.2025, 16:30 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: I think lighter does not imply ultralight X-Alps style gear ... just lighter
11.11.2025, 16:32 - +1 (510) 299-3701: That is a tradeoff that you can make as a consumer. We shouldn’t try to dictate to consumers what is important to them. We should only try to remove/reduce distortions introduced by a competitive arms race. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 16:33 - Sopot - Meet Director: How do you know what is important to them ?
11.11.2025, 16:34 - +386 31 404 688: Whilst this is all interesting, isn't it completely off track to ballast discussion?
11.11.2025, 16:34 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: by just seeing what they prefer to buy
11.11.2025, 16:35 - Sopot - Meet Director: I don't see many people competitng with light gear
11.11.2025, 16:36 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: because there is no incentive. discussion in circle !  but on the hill with leasure pilots, whithout incentive for heavy weight, they tends to prefer light gears.
11.11.2025, 16:36 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Yes, that is exactly the kind of distortion that would be good to reduce.
11.11.2025, 16:37 - Sopot - Meet Director: Now the consumer choices tells me one thing: the performance is king.
11.11.2025, 16:38 - +33 6 62 51 67 03: Not in the global market Daniel
11.11.2025, 16:38 - Sopot - Meet Director: If the performance is the same - of course the pilots will prefer lighter gear
11.11.2025, 16:38 - Sopot - Meet Director: Don't we speak about competitions ?!
11.11.2025, 16:40 - +1 (510) 299-3701: There is not necessarily a tradeoff between performance and weight, at least to a point. Comp harnesses have a lot more and thicker webbing  and other parts than is needed to achieve the stability and comfort desired. There is just no incentive to optimize on weight currently.
11.11.2025, 16:46 - Julien Garcia: We speak about reducing the amount of ballast in competition. The data we have show average bag way over 25 Kg in every body weight category.
11.11.2025, 17:06 - +32 486 31 34 36: Less protection….. I beg to differ. I’d feel better protected in a F-Race 2 with a thick inflatable protection than in a Sub with a 5cm koroyd
11.11.2025, 17:06 - +43 664 75129998: @⁨~Zsolt Ero⁩ the protector size is not at all linear with the drag of the harness. So already because of that this idea is dead. It would need expensive wind tunnel testing for each harness to define that. We are not formula one… <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 17:10 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Josh had an interesting idea about drag penalty and certification G results, just as an incentive for bigger protection (although not necessarly fair). protection thickness does not work well pratically. You can't measure thickness relieably because it's often soft, sometimes inflatable, often complex 3D shaped. And G results makes more sense than thickness anyway. Please Josh, can you liaize with Zsolt on that matter ?
11.11.2025, 17:10 - Sopot - Meet Director: Ok, but what is the target? My bag is 23 kg and I have ZERO kg ballast. In my case it cannot be reduced more. What is the acceptable amount of ballast ?  I'm sure that it's more than zero. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 17:15 - Julien Garcia: It will go for the next group 💪🏻
11.11.2025, 17:16 - Julien Garcia: If we would all be like you I think all this would be less of a problem. You have one of the lightest bag of the stats. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 17:17 - Sopot - Meet Director: Julien, what is the acceptable amount of ballast for you personally ?
11.11.2025, 17:17 - Julien Garcia: 23-25 would be a balance.
11.11.2025, 17:17 - Julien Garcia: I go to 35 right now. Flying M where I could do S.
11.11.2025, 17:18 - Sopot - Meet Director: if the equipment is 20 - it means that you will be fine with 3-5 kg ballast ?
11.11.2025, 17:18 - Julien Garcia: To adjust size matching probably yes
11.11.2025, 17:19 - Julien Garcia: I'm 76 Kg (when fit) by the way.
11.11.2025, 17:19 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: I'm 80kg, I would fly a S (all up 105)
11.11.2025, 17:21 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: and there will be more incentive to include more glider sizes. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 17:26 - +386 31 404 688: I'm 84 and my natural take off weight is 108 on CCC. So I carry 4-7kg ballast to become competitive on my wing 112-115kg). I hate the ballast.

If the Enzo could be ordered in 110kg, I would buy it. Scaling is allowed, but the manufacturers rarely offer it.

5kg steps and Equalisers are the way forwards for the majority 💥
11.11.2025, 17:34 - Sopot - Meet Director: OK, it would be good to have the answer of those 2 questions:
1. What is the average amount of ballast competition pilots carry now ?
2. What is the amount of ballast pilots consider as "not a problem, acceptable" ?
11.11.2025, 17:35 - Julien Garcia: 1) is on the website already
11.11.2025, 17:35 - Julien Garcia: 2) is unknown
11.11.2025, 17:37 - Julien Garcia: I would answer 3-5 Kg. What have you in mind ? Designing weight categories ?
11.11.2025, 17:37 - Sopot - Meet Director: 3-5 kg could be water
11.11.2025, 17:38 - Julien Garcia: About Ballast being a problem or not we already had a poll
11.11.2025, 17:38 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: 5kg is a lot
11.11.2025, 17:38 - Sopot - Meet Director: if all competitions could provide water at the take-off  - it would be perfect
11.11.2025, 17:39 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: What is the amount of ballast pilots consider as "not a problem, acceptable" ?    They would answer as little as possible, I guess
11.11.2025, 17:39 - Julien Garcia: Upon 190 votes, 180 believe there is a problem with ballast
11.11.2025, 17:40 - Julien Garcia: 4 only believe there is no problem
11.11.2025, 17:40 - Sopot - Meet Director: Yes, now it is a problem. But how much is NOT a problem?
11.11.2025, 17:40 - Julien Garcia: 28 believe the problem is only for light pilots (below 60)
11.11.2025, 17:40 - Julien Garcia: It implies what we have NOW is a problem
11.11.2025, 17:41 - +34 692 82 41 02: Ballast in a certain dose is very good, it allows you to fly the glider right in the weight you like and you can change it depending on the conditions or the flying site
11.11.2025, 17:41 - Julien Garcia: And this is to be found in the charts I provided
11.11.2025, 17:41 - Julien Garcia: What we have now (and is believed to be a problem) is bags over 25Kg for most.
11.11.2025, 17:43 - Julien Garcia: https://gagglereport.org/ballast/issue
11.11.2025, 17:44 - Julien Garcia: That's the page to explain best ballast issue so far
11.11.2025, 17:46 - Julien Garcia: I aknowledge this I don't know. We will ask
11.11.2025, 17:46 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Julien, what is the definition of "bags" ?
Total flying weight - body weight?
11.11.2025, 17:46 - Julien Garcia: Exactly
11.11.2025, 17:49 - Sopot - Meet Director: Bag is the equipment + the ballast you cannot afford to throw away.
11.11.2025, 17:49 - Julien Garcia: No bag is total flying weight - body weight
11.11.2025, 17:50 - Julien Garcia: There is no distinction (so far) throwable ballast or no
11.11.2025, 17:51 - Julien Garcia: The bag you carry when you go to TO if it is more clear <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 18:01 - Julien Garcia: Sorry I said a mistake. Declared flying weight - body weight
11.11.2025, 18:01 - Julien Garcia: Not the max one. DECLARED one.
11.11.2025, 18:28 - +386 31 606 148: OMG... i hardly digg out of 350 messages. What a nightmare. 😮‍💨
Some of them are trying to reinvent the wheel! As I can see, we will make this sport even worse, then it was.
The debate: bigger guys=> bigger harness, bigger hands etc.. c'mon... I would say, its nonsense. The diference in real aerodynamic is negligible! If not, and we can measure it on our gliders... then I'm astonished how far have we gone. More than in F1!! Does anyone in any sport does that?? Bigger guys, bigger helmet, arms.. etc...  So please, stop making it more complicated, than it is. Sorry if being rude..😇 Just thinking... at what details we are talking... are we aware of it??
... then...Lets try to polish our hemlents and harnesses .. or even gliders...
Heh... in comparison to that... there is "tone of differences" in glider manufacturing =>performances. Lets compensate that.. 😏


But as emphasized. There is MUCH bigger issue about OVERALL performance of the bigger glider. Which means. Handling, safety, feeling, collapse resistance, how much can you push on it, etc.. NOT just some ... drag... i know, guys from bigger gliders and not being able to try smaller ones, wont understand. But that is the FACT.
There is also a lot of "movement in the air and glider dynamic"... etc...  I, assume that brings all this (drag, noodles, etc..) to another perspective not just theoretical drag on the computer or even measured in calm air. (Im not aerodynamic engineering, so I might be wrong).

Making decison based on voting, is tottaly wrong. Since it wont give the right picture. If there something must be done, then it has to be done based on data, facts and study.

Based on all that, I personally feel a lot safer, to bring more ballast and fly an M size, rather than S or even smaller one.

Again. I dont like noodles, since its jus more a imaginary solutuon. And I don't approve ballast limitatons.
11.11.2025, 19:35 - +1 (510) 299-3701: What’s your name D.O.? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 19:36 - Sopot - Meet Director: Dušan Orož
11.11.2025, 19:36 - Sopot - Meet Director: From Slovenia
11.11.2025, 19:38 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Oh, right, I think you said that before. Is it possible to update your profile?
11.11.2025, 19:39 - Julien Garcia: I believe it is another trouble we face with whatsapp isn't it ?
11.11.2025, 19:42 - +386 31 606 148: Sorry. I made changes. I hope it will be visible now.
As said. I have e.g. 17 years of experiences in highest level competitions, and  flown mostly all competition gliders, including open class...etc...
11.11.2025, 19:42 - +1 (510) 299-3701: It is, thanks!

And yes, your name is familiar to me. I’m sure we’ve competed together multiple times. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 19:47 - +386 31 606 148: Its a pity, that most of the top guns do not express their opinions. And also "step out".... noone likes to be exposed.  But... I'm/we are used that. Since in most cases, pilots are "strange species" in that matter...
And then... the decisions are mostly made by the ones, that actually do not compete or are not in the higher level, or do not know the whole history... <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 19:50 - Julien Garcia: I believe we are changing that right now Dusan
11.11.2025, 19:50 - Julien Garcia: Each will be able to have an impact on their own category.
11.11.2025, 19:51 - +386 31 606 148: I know the purpose.... but...Im not (enough) convinced....
11.11.2025, 19:51 - +386 31 606 148: But... 🤞
11.11.2025, 19:51 - Julien Garcia: Neither do I. Time will tell
11.11.2025, 19:51 - Julien Garcia: 😃
11.11.2025, 19:53 - +386 31 606 148: And kudos to your effort!
11.11.2025, 19:58 - Julien Garcia: Kudos for participating
11.11.2025, 20:09 - +44 7446 445157: Event organisers may also need to consider the liability implications if an incident occurs during their event which requires competitors to use equalisers and which could be argued takes their wing out of certification.
11.11.2025, 20:09 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Let’s not make this kind of liability argument. It can be used to spread fear about anything you don’t like. And it’s like saying Voldemort’s name. You don’t want to summon lawyers. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 20:13 - +1 (510) 299-3701: If you think it’s a real risk then argue for that.
11.11.2025, 20:13 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Organizing competitions is a liability. Period
11.11.2025, 20:20 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: This argument has been brought several time. There is nothing such has wing being taken out of certification. No wing is flown with the same harness has the certification, while this does affect for sure the behavior. When you do some triming in your maillon, you affect line strength. any collapse you'll take is different from the norm's collapse, When you pull some brakes during a collapse, you are out of the certification. Certification is a normative criteria, a way to compare canopies behavior to some standard. When you fly, there is no divinity anymore, it's you and a piece of cloth.
11.11.2025, 20:21 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: gluing numbers on a canopy would affect much more certification (if you follow this false logic) <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 20:23 - +44 7446 445157: To be clear, I'm an advocate of change to address the ballast issue and my view (currently).is  the equalisers solution appears to be the best we can implement in the short term.

I mention organiser liability so that these things can be considered by relevant parties and potentially mitigated.
11.11.2025, 20:31 - Mateusz Gajczewski: Can we add this info to FAQ for equalizers? I'd really want to make sure that putting equalizers on a certified and professionally inspected wing doesn't lead to any issues with insurance companies. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 20:32 - Julien Garcia: Ok
11.11.2025, 20:35 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Wouldn’t that be analogous to any kind of addition to a harness or helmet such as putting a speaker mic or different speed bar on the harness or a gopro on a helmet?
11.11.2025, 20:37 - +1 (284) 541-0307: <Pominięto multimedia>
11.11.2025, 20:40 - +49 177 4367477: No I think that the noodles need to be certified by the manufacturer. It's kind of a structural alteration
11.11.2025, 20:41 - +1 (510) 299-3701: I don’t think so. It’s adding a small amount of drag without compromising the structure at all. Drogue chutes add much more drag.
11.11.2025, 20:43 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: Absolutly not
11.11.2025, 20:46 - +49 177 4367477: Would make things easier a lot...  I suppose there where some stall test or similar already?
11.11.2025, 20:48 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Yes. See bottom of FAQ at https://gagglereport.org/ballast/equalizers
11.11.2025, 20:51 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: Luc, I understand the equalizers are quite a cheap piece of equipment.
Only a few euros.
If they come with the new wings, with those euros added to the price, it will solve a lot of the logistics for the future
11.11.2025, 20:54 - +49 177 4367477: OK, so that's what I meant with certified. Someone already tried it out what the behavior is when in manouvers 👍🏼 <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 20:56 - +1 (510) 299-3701: Seems very doable to have them be an option like an accordion bag to include.
