11.11.2025, 00:45 - +1 (510) 299-3701: In principle I like the idea of letting pilots vote with their feet, but in this case I suspect it would lead to little change.

We already have a lightweight class at many Cat. 2s and it has had hardly any effect on pilots’ ballasting and glider size choices.

Until a solution is on the horizon at a Cat 1, most pilots won’t see it as real.
11.11.2025, 00:47 - +1 (510) 299-3701: There is also a question of how many organizers would want to make their lives more complex by having more classes.

Another way the free market could work is that if equalizers start to catch on, some Cat 2s will require them and others won’t. Pilots who care enough will choose their events accordingly.
11.11.2025, 00:49 - +1 (510) 299-3701: that could lead to de facto weight class competitions if some heavy pilots avoid comps with equalizers.
11.11.2025, 06:53 - +44 7815 693738: That’s assuming that most pilots only do comps to get in to CAT1’s. I don’t think there are 7500 pilots competing for a team place.
11.11.2025, 06:57 - Sopot - Meet Director: If weight categories are introduced in WPRS - they will have immediate adoption through the whole competition scene (Cat1s and Cat2s).
If equalizers are introduced - there will be a long transitional period.
11.11.2025, 06:58 - +44 7815 693738: In the Brits we have; overall, female, sports class, best new comer, Reynolds etc. I don’t think categories increase the workload much, they just add a bit of time to the closing ceremony. Reynolds doesn’t work at the moment because there is still an overall, if you remove that the categories have equal importance.
11.11.2025, 06:59 - +44 7815 693738: Exactly 👍
11.11.2025, 07:25 - +386 31 404 688: Actually, the Reynolds does add quite a bit of work as you need to know the wing size the pilot is flying. Pilots have a habit of putting incorrect data on their forms, often misunderstanding the question about weight, or leaving it blank.

A lot of that stems from either the class not being applicable to them, or their not taking it seriously enough. 

If more events used it, it would become less work.
11.11.2025, 07:26 - +386 31 404 688: That said, it isn't a huge job. Just normal scoring stuff. No different to trying to get their correct wing and harness info etc
11.11.2025, 07:28 - +386 31 404 688: Pilots are lazy. Systems need to be simple. 👻

I'd support Max weight of a wing being printed on a wingtip 🙏
11.11.2025, 09:21 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: All debates here are about forcing changes into Cat1 and WPRS.

No need to debate anything for the 7500 pilots not interested in the highest level, because Cat2 are free to do what they like as they do it right now.

I thought it was clear that creating one or two lightweight classes did not solve the ballast problem at all
11.11.2025, 09:55 - Sopot - Meet Director: Cat2s are significant because they are the main contributor of points for WPRS. If for example there is a lightweight category - the selection for Cat1 Lightweight might be according to Lightweight WPRS ranking ...
11.11.2025, 09:56 - +49 1573 4866279: but cat1 selection is never really according to wprs.
11.11.2025, 09:56 - Sopot - Meet Director: It is
11.11.2025, 09:57 - Sopot - Meet Director: At least the qualification
11.11.2025, 09:57 - Sopot - Meet Director: I know many countries (NACs) do their decision who to send according to pilot's WPRS ranking <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 09:58 - +44 7815 693738: Eduardo than was quite a worrying post. We are not here to force anything. If a proposal is good it is more likely to be accepted. CAT1’s and WPRS are separate issues albeit slightly liked. My document covers more than 1 or 2 weight classes and it covers WPRS, but needs more input on CAT1’s. 

CAT2’s can’t “do what they like”, they have to conform to the current WPRS rules so having categories doesn’t work at the moment. If they want to give out WPRS points they are bound by those rules. If those rules change it will affect the masses. You are saying that you want to force a rule through that will only benefit the top 120 pilots and completely disregard the affect it will have on over 7000 other people? Thats just not morally right, they matter too.
11.11.2025, 10:02 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: That is not at all what I said.
But this is becoming a conversation that makes no sense.
People have a position taken, and hear no arguments
11.11.2025, 10:02 - +49 1573 4866279: but they aren't bound to it. And how would selection through lw WPRS work? another +1 for all teams?
11.11.2025, 10:04 - Sopot - Meet Director: Yes. This topic has to be discussed and decided if the LW category is approved
11.11.2025, 10:05 - +32 486 31 34 36: Also, every top pilot went through the Cat 2’s during his progression at one point of time,  which means if with time, the newcomers will feed the top pilots and if those were playing with these rules from the start, they won’t have any problems with that when they will reach Cat 1. Si to me, having these rules in Cat 2’s is also the way to go
11.11.2025, 10:09 - +44 7815 693738: I am trying to encourage input, to bring detailed solutions, not just opinions.

Maybe there are misuderstandings.
11.11.2025, 10:40 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: The vast majority of the 7500 pilots you mention DO NOT fly CCC gliders.

But weight classes are irrespective of glider classes
11.11.2025, 10:41 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: So a EN-B or EN-C  pilot will compete in the same weight class than a serial or CCC glider? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 10:42 - Sopot - Meet Director: And he will have a choice: fly in his weight category or carry ballast and fly in Overal category
11.11.2025, 10:44 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: But then you want weight classes to give medals, not to solve ballast problems
11.11.2025, 10:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: Yes - the medals will solve the ballast problem
11.11.2025, 10:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: This is what I expect
11.11.2025, 10:45 - Sopot - Meet Director: Of course ther will be people choosing to carry ballast
11.11.2025, 10:46 - Sopot - Meet Director: But at least they will have the option to skip the ballast
11.11.2025, 10:46 - Sopot - Meet Director: Now they don't have this option
11.11.2025, 10:48 - +386 31 404 688: There seems to be two threads running concurrently here. One to solve ballast at CAT1 by giving medals, and one to solve all events by controlling the WPRS.

They are very different things.

Maybe this group needs splitting into two?
11.11.2025, 10:50 - Sopot - Meet Director: Two sides of the same coin
11.11.2025, 10:51 - +44 7815 693738: For me it’s to solve the ballast issue for everyone. Ballasting in CAT2’s is still a problem. In my opinion the only way that categories will work is if WPRS change to award multiple winners. So the two are the same.
11.11.2025, 10:54 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: @⁨Sopot - Meet Director⁩ : how many weight category would you now like in your plan ?
11.11.2025, 10:54 - Sopot - Meet Director: Malin, I hope that you are aware that you cannot impose things on Cat2s. You can only create incentives
11.11.2025, 10:54 - Sopot - Meet Director: Only one for now
11.11.2025, 10:55 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: you mean two ?
11.11.2025, 10:55 - +44 7815 693738: I think this is where our thoughts differ. I don’t think categories work if you still have an overall winner, and WPRS stays the same. That’s why I think overall comps and multi winner ones should be separate. Then everyone is happy.
11.11.2025, 10:55 - +386 31 404 688: But they are not the same.

We have Junior category in WPRS, but we do not have Junior medal at CAT1.

Soon we will have Sports category in WPRS. But we do have them in CAT1.

The exception to the above two is there is a specific Junior Worlds, and soon there may be a Sports worlds.

So if you are looking to changing WPRS, that is one thing. But CAT1 is completely different and a separate proposal and approach. You do not need to change WPRS for a 'class' in CAT1 just as you don't need to change CAT1 to change WPRS. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 10:55 - Sopot - Meet Director: Maybe after some years (and if it seems necessary) - another one
11.11.2025, 10:56 - +386 31 404 688: Just to outline the current WPRS process.

The only existing rules in CIVL for WPRS is that:
♦ a ranking order for the event must be submitted. The order they finished 1st to last. The points they achieve in the event are irrelevant. Just their position counts.
♦ The results must identify CIVL number, Nationality (by Sporting licence), sex, glider and if they hold a valid sporting licence.
♦ The organiser must upload IGC tracks and incident reports.

That is pretty much it.

The system will then process all that info and create the WPRS ranking based on the formula in Section 7e. It is a single calculation for a single score.

The process does not care about classes within the event. They are not uploaded into the final results. They are for local use only. It is entirely optional for the organiser if he wants classes or not, and what those classes are. Even they Sports class results will not be uploaded to the WPRS as the system will already be able to identify the class of a glider from the glider model. Weight is a whole new dimension not presently in the system at all.

Things like Junior & Female rankings in WPRS are just selector buttons to filter out the other pilots. The new Sports ranking will use the same filter technique.

So to have weight as part of the WPRS equation it would require a new filter and a way of identifying the pilots that comply with the filter, The existing Sports filter has taken nearly 2 years from proposal to implementation. 

You could just keep the LW class local to the comp, so at a CAT1, the organiser just collects the data at the event registration, the same as CAT2 does it. No pre-selection required.

Currently a CAT1 only identifies the top overall and top female. Juniors, despite being a part of WPRS they are not identified at a CAT1. Nor will the top sports pilot be.

Hopefully that helps you identify what parts of the system would need change for any new proposals.
11.11.2025, 10:58 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: So I suppose you mean, one light weight category and one heavy weight category. How do you deal with people ballasting up to the top of the light weight category ?
11.11.2025, 10:59 - +44 7815 693738: That’s why I said in my document that CAT1’s wasn’t the most pressing issue, but I might have been wrong if people think that it is pilots main motivation for doing comps.
11.11.2025, 11:01 - Sopot - Meet Director: Malin, you are correct about the need to separate the groups. But if we go this way - we have to do it first with men/women and then with lightweight/heavyweight
11.11.2025, 11:02 - +44 7815 693738: Men and women are already split. That can stay unchanged.
11.11.2025, 11:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: Luc, light pilots will do it anyway because they don't like how smallest gliders fly (handlingwise)
11.11.2025, 11:02 - Sopot - Meet Director: Absolutely not
11.11.2025, 11:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: There is Overall and Female
11.11.2025, 11:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: A woman can get 2 medals
11.11.2025, 11:03 - Sopot - Meet Director: A man cannot get 2 medals regardless of how good he is
11.11.2025, 11:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: So this means that now women have more opportunities than men.
11.11.2025, 11:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: But we are Ok with this
11.11.2025, 11:06 - Sopot - Meet Director: It's acceptable
11.11.2025, 11:13 - +386 31 404 688: I don't know if it is acceptable. But we accept it 😊
11.11.2025, 11:14 - Sopot - Meet Director: I personally am Ok if, let's say we have a LW category, and a small chinese girl wins a competition - she goes home with 3 medals
11.11.2025, 11:14 - +44 7815 693738: What are you suggesting then?
11.11.2025, 11:16 - Sopot - Meet Director: I don't think we have reached the stage of the development to separate women from men <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
11.11.2025, 11:16 - Sopot - Meet Director: Maybe in the distant future...
11.11.2025, 11:16 - Sopot - Meet Director: But not now

11.11.2025, 11:32 - +44 7446 445157: Is it possible to analyse the weight data we have to see how the ballast issue exists across glider classes and comp categories.

My perception is that 'the ballast issue' is narrowly contained to those pilots currently (& aspiring to) flying CCCs in Cat 1s.  I cannot think of any EN-C and below pilots that significantly ballast up.

Why is this relevant?  If the data supports the hypothesis, the ballast issue has to solved for Cat1s first and foremost.
