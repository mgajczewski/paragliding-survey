12.11.2025, 02:00 - +82 10-9034-5585: The Equalizer debate is not truly about wing size or fairness —
it is the direct result of one glider model monopolizing the competition scene.

Today, nearly the entire top-level field flies the same wing (Enzo3).
With a single model dominating the sport:

Natural equipment diversity disappears

Innovation slows down

Performance differences within one model become “global fairness issues”

Rules start being shaped around a single manufacturer’s product

Equalizer exists only because the sport has become effectively single-model standardized by default.
In a healthy, competitive environment with multiple designs and philosophies,
this device would never be discussed.

The Equalizer proposes adding artificial drag to large sizes.
But handicapping a single dominant model is not progress —
it simply preserves the monopoly instead of addressing it.

Adding drag is:

Aerodynamically inefficient

Potentially harmful to stability and recovery behavior

A barrier to genuine R&D and design evolution

A mechanism that locks the sport into one model even longer

True fairness and safety come from open competition and equipment diversity, not from mechanical handicaps that maintain a monopoly.

The problem is not big wings.
It is one wing dominating the sport.

We believe the sport must move toward innovation, diversity, and freedom of design,
not toward compensating for the side-effects of a single-model era.

Gin Gliders supports rules and environments that encourage multiple high-performance solutions —
not a system where equipment evolution is replaced by drag devices.
12.11.2025, 02:02 - Julien Garcia: Interesting point of view Gin. How is this drag device contributing to renforce Ozone monopole ?
12.11.2025, 02:04 - +54 9 11 4417-7923: I do not see a monopoly
I see customer choice
12.11.2025, 02:04 - +82 10-9034-5585: almost
12.11.2025, 02:05 - Julien Garcia: I'm interested learning more
12.11.2025, 02:05 - Julien Garcia: I read carefully the assumption but I do not follow the logic.
12.11.2025, 02:06 - Julien Garcia: @⁨~Nuno Virgílio⁩ seem to have understood ? How this drag device reinforce Ozone more than Gin ?
12.11.2025, 02:10 - Julien Garcia: I read "Performance différences within one model become 'global fairness issues'" in my understanding this issue with ballast comes a long way. 2 arguments :
12.11.2025, 02:10 - Julien Garcia: 1) PWCA re introduced ballast limits in 2005. People overballast for a reason which is performance.
12.11.2025, 02:12 - +82 10-9034-5585: The Equalizer is positioned as a fairness tool.
However, it only responds to performance asymmetry within a single model, not across the competitive market.

Thus, the core question is:

Does intra-model equalization promote fair competition,
or does it entrench the dominant model and suppress diversity?
12.11.2025, 02:12 - Julien Garcia: 2) We just spent one full week on the topics providing datas about wings size différence (Bruce Goldsmith / Rene Falquier / Luc Armant). I saw no data allowing me to believe there is no différence in between size. I'm happy to be corrected
12.11.2025, 02:13 - +82 10-9034-5585: High-performance paragliding competitions are currently characterized by extreme concentration of equipment usage, with one model (Ozone Enzo3) dominating the majority of the competitive field.
This condition represents a de-facto equipment monoculture.

In this environment, performance differences between wing sizes within the same model have emerged as a fairness concern.

The proposed Equalizer introduces external drag to large sizes to align performance across sizes.
12.11.2025, 02:14 - Julien Garcia: Are you saying there is less difference in size in other design (Gin / Niviuk) ?
12.11.2025, 02:14 - Julien Garcia: I understood it this way
12.11.2025, 02:14 - Julien Garcia: Just an Enzo 3 / Ozone problem ?
12.11.2025, 02:15 - +82 10-9034-5585: What if A brand S size flys better than B brand L size?
12.11.2025, 02:16 - Julien Garcia: We are proposing to compensate S pilots from A brand to L pilot from the same brand.
12.11.2025, 02:17 - Julien Garcia: Size difference are a result of aerodynamical factors. Your wings are affected to isn't it ? <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 02:17 - Julien Garcia: Brand B would need to improve. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 02:17 - +82 10-9034-5585: As I said L size pilots are big and they have bigger body drag too.
12.11.2025, 02:18 - Julien Garcia: This is something I can understand.
12.11.2025, 02:18 - +43 664 75129998: Sorry Mr. Gin but your points between market monopoly, glider development and the Equalizer doesn’t make any sense to me.
12.11.2025, 02:18 - Julien Garcia: I did not with the idea of reinforcing a monopole
12.11.2025, 02:18 - Julien Garcia: I agree on the almost monopole situation <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 02:19 - +82 10-9034-5585: I am not saying monopole but dominated
12.11.2025, 02:19 - Julien Garcia: But I don't see how this rule would make it stronger
12.11.2025, 02:19 - +852 9475 5772: Maybe “one design” concept should also be discussed
12.11.2025, 02:19 - +82 10-9034-5585: No sense
12.11.2025, 02:19 - Julien Garcia: We definitly can. And I personnaly like the idea
12.11.2025, 02:19 - Julien Garcia: But it's another working group
12.11.2025, 02:20 - Julien Garcia: We need to propose something else out of all this
12.11.2025, 02:20 - Julien Garcia: Procédure is to add there https://gagglereport.org/groups
12.11.2025, 02:20 - +82 10-9034-5585: The Equalizer mechanism does not increase competition fairness in the paragliding ecosystem.
Instead, it:

Reinforces the current dominant model as the standard benchmark

Reduces incentives for equipment innovation and model diversification

Stabilizes market concentration and technological stagnation

For sustainable competition equity, model-neutral frameworks encouraging equipment diversity are required, rather than mechanical equalization within a monopoly environment.
12.11.2025, 02:21 - Julien Garcia: I'm sure there is some logic in what you bring.
12.11.2025, 02:21 - +43 664 75129998: Why?
12.11.2025, 02:22 - Julien Garcia: I just cannot make any sense out of it for the moment.
12.11.2025, 02:23 - Julien Garcia: Note that I would love to have more choices and more diversity indeed
12.11.2025, 02:23 - +43 664 75129998: That would be the ultimate solution for sure but looking at the controversy around a much more basic issue (Ballast) I have lost all hope 😂
12.11.2025, 02:23 - Julien Garcia: Same boat
12.11.2025, 02:25 - +82 10-9034-5585: My point isn’t that the Equalizer is a bad idea in isolation —
it’s that the timing and context matter.

Right now, when one glider model is used by the vast majority of top pilots,
a device designed to “balance that model internally” ends up:

standardizing the sport around that one design,

suppressing incentives for alternative designs,

and potentially slowing overall technical evolution.

It’s a systems effect, not a criticism of the concept or the brand.
12.11.2025, 02:26 - +852 9475 5772: We need stronger leadership from civl…
12.11.2025, 02:28 - Julien Garcia: I'm not the one who said it this time
12.11.2025, 02:40 - +852 9475 5772: I totally understand the frustrations and your perspective. When one model dominates, the R&D of other brands might be restricted, as they don't have same amount of data and feedback for further development. Potentially it becomes challenging to create the next generation of products that can compete with the dominant model. Additionally, the Equalizer is based on the Luc's calculations(in my understanding), which means that other manufacturer's calculations might not align. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 02:40 - +1 (850) 702-1893: I agree that fostering more innovation in wing design is good. Right now yes, Ozone has a huge CCC market share, followed by Niviuk. 

But I don’t see how equalizers - at all - stifle innovation and preserve this state of affairs. That’s a really puzzling argument. 

Aerodynamics are aerodynamics. The size issue is not confined to Ozone - at all. Yes, some companies make better-performing small gliders than others (BGD is to be commended for putting real effort into reducing line size and drag on their smallest sizes). But all are affected by the same problem. 

Sorry - what you’re saying makes no sense.
12.11.2025, 02:46 - +82 10-9034-5585: Well, you will see, Violet
12.11.2025, 02:47 - Julien Garcia: Others calculations have been shared this week. One by an independant enthousiast amator. Another statistical approach by another designer (BGD). They seem to conclude the same about difference in size. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 02:49 - Julien Garcia: <Pominięto multimedia>
12.11.2025, 02:49 - Julien Garcia: <Pominięto multimedia>
12.11.2025, 02:49 - Julien Garcia: <Pominięto multimedia>
12.11.2025, 02:49 - Julien Garcia: <Pominięto multimedia>
12.11.2025, 02:49 - Julien Garcia: This is the data we have from Lukas <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 02:50 - Julien Garcia: He simulated with and without Equalizers.
12.11.2025, 02:50 - Julien Garcia: As far as I understood it is a theoritical drag analysis. There is no model involved
12.11.2025, 02:51 - Julien Garcia: Gin please I know you know many things we don't. We surely miss a point.
12.11.2025, 06:59 - +41 78 870 02 30: @⁨Julien Garcia⁩ are we sure these data are peer reviewed independently as evidence and not just theoretical references? Isn’t it important to clarify before we us it as reference for any voting or decision.
Rushing this process could bring us back to square one and lose some friends on the way too. 
But of course if we want to just do something for the sack of doing somthing then follow PwCA lead…
I suggest again to get deligates to vote and pass on another weight class as it almost passed in 2019. Without getting too excited about multiple categories and going crazy with WPRS and global changes. This is the first best choice we missed years ago.
12.11.2025, 07:20 - +49 1573 4866279: Lukas' Data uses a drag calculation for the pilot/harness which puts a lot more weight on the size of the pilot, so he uses extra equalisers to adjust the performance of small pilots flying big wings. This is an additional step compared to Luc's calculations and supports Gins claim that Luc's calculations don't put enough weight on pilot size, while Luc says the effect of harness size is much smaller. 
Maybe it would help if manufacturers share some more data on the drag of their harnesses and different sizes? Gins Marketing put a lot of value into the R&D effort for the GR5, so surely they have some cfd data or wind tunnel measurements to support his claim?
12.11.2025, 07:47 - +41 78 870 02 30: It would be great to have reference and methodology to the charts in circulation, 
specially if they are used as evidence.
12.11.2025, 08:25 - +33 7 67 76 25 90: I thought the point of this working group was to increase safety in our sport. Here the only thing that people are talking about is performance, podiums, etc...
12.11.2025, 09:16 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: We, many designers and experts, (but maybe not Mr GIN ?) are saying that for a given paraglider model, when you scale down you have a loss of performance due to some scale effects which are laws of physics. It’s been detailed in the xls I attached here a while ago. Here attached again. 
In a few worlds, most of the scale effect comes from the fact the harness drag does not decrease in the same proportion as the total weight in flight. When you go from 130kg to 65kg, if you want to keep the same performance, you would need the harness drag to be twice smaller. But, we all know that the harness front section is unchanged with size. Only arms extending out, helmet or small part of the torso makes a minor change which is included in the current draft. As a result, there is a significant loss of performance while scaling down. And as a result, pilots are preferring to ballast up in order to fly one or two sizes above what they would naturally fly. This existed long before the Enzo3.

On top of that, there is a little bit of Reynolds scale effect, which is also a very well known law of physics. 

Here we are talking of scaling down or up from a given model. And we are talking of the physical reality that is completely independent from the wing’s brand, can be GIN, Niviuk or Ozone, it does not matter. 

And finally, there is the fact that manufacturers often use the same line diameter for the small size than for the big size. That also creates a scale effect not in favor of the small size. In the current draft of Size Equalizers, it is considered that the manufacturer has done the effort of optimising line diameter for each size (which is not the case currently on all sizes of Enzo3, for example). Now if a manufacturer doesn't do it, that will be handicapping more the small sizes of his model. However a pilot would still have the choice to use another brand where the line has been optimized. However, note that in EN norms, a manufacturer is not allowed to have a size smaller than 100kg overall with thinner lines than sizes > 100kg. This, I hope, will be corrected in upcoming EN norms. 

Now, if a manufacturer wants to create big sizes that are performing worse than small sizes, it can’t happen by just a scale between these sizes. It can only happen if the manufacturer includes some handicapping features to its bigger size. Why would it do that ?  I don’t know, pilots could still buy big sizes from another brand or model, but that should not interfere with the issue we are trying to solve here.

Now, off topic about the fact that competition wings are only Enzo3. I also feel it would be nicer to have more brands. Few manufacturers and I are investing time and energy to try to renew the CCC for something safer and easier in design, hopefully bringing more manufacturers into the game. @Mr GIN, if you want to join the effort, you are welcome, but I’ve seen the opposite of help on that matter for the moment. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 09:17 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: <Pominięto multimedia>
12.11.2025, 09:19 - +33 6 15 67 83 97: On top of that, Mr Goldsmith says that there is another handicaping scale effect for small sizes when they go through turbulences. I've seen some curves but not the detail fo the calculation. If that is true, we'd see that after one or two seasons with current Equalizer. Then we'd have to increase even more the Equalizer compensation.
12.11.2025, 09:36 - Julien Garcia: @⁨~R⁩ maybe I understood you wrongly in this case sorry in advance.  Datas are published by different providers explaining the problem in the different page of the ballast marathon. They use 3 different methods : Luc, Rene Falquier, Lukas. Showing numbers, statistics, crossing different manufacturer point of views is what allow a community to cross check. Digging into it as Lukas did is what allow a community to build trust and to progress. What I personnaly do find rude, is to come with strong assumption without any data or to claim the numbers are just faked 🤷🏻. I'm not sure this paranoïa will help the community to grow. We said we would want to be data driven. For ages we talked without putting the numbers now they are here we still find a way to say they may be cheated or invented. Reality is some designers put tremendous effort from their job time to help us understand what curently affect us. It is true we need to check their assumptions based on the datas they provide and we really do. Best way to contest a set of datas is to contest the methodology or find a clever way and get different numbers. Now I'd like to know what seems wrong in what was presented ? https://gagglereport.org/ballast/issue <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 09:37 - +82 10-9034-5585: @Luc, I am not the only one in opposite side. They are shy to say something wrong??
Someone has different opinion and this is the open discussion.
12.11.2025, 09:39 - Julien Garcia: @⁨~Ginseok song⁩ it is ok to have a different opinion and I thank you for your participation. It would be great if we could understand the Logic behind what you said about Equalizers reinforcing Ozone domination. What are the datas supporting size difference are only an Ozone problem please ?
12.11.2025, 09:51 - Julien Garcia: https://gagglereport.org/ballast/issue
12.11.2025, 09:52 - Julien Garcia: I am happy to post any data set in the issue up there
12.11.2025, 09:53 - +49 1515 7868601: As far as I understood, @⁨~Luc Armant⁩ tried to correct his ideas being misrepresented as equalizing Enzo 3 performance whereas he argues it is about equalizing a general scale effect which is a consequence of the laws of physics and therefore affects any brand the same way.

Debunking this would require arguments, why there is no general disadvantage for smaller gliders because of scaling that results from the laws of physics. I think no such arguments were presented so far as @⁨Julien Garcia⁩ pointed out. But anyone is free to do so.
12.11.2025, 10:08 - +386 31 404 688: I don't think Gin was denying this affect exists at all. I think he was trying to highlight that implementing this would remove further opportunity for manufacturers to improve wing design. As in the post above ☝

I think it is well known that the XXS doesn't fly very well and that there is no development in that area due to the small sales. It is argued that the equalizers will increase the sales thus giving manufacturers the incentive to work on them more. Maybe that is true, maybe not. You could also argue that the equalizers equalize the performance in sizes and thus remove all incentive to develop them. Even more so as both Luc and Bruce have indicated the next competition wings (Enzo4 & Diva3) are likely to be EN-D to get around the CCC limitations (rewind to 2012). So why would they work on a better XXS CCC wing?

This perspective can't really be a data driven discussion as it is an opinion.
12.11.2025, 10:11 - +44 7446 445157: And perhaps there ought to be a "no change" option in the poll.

(This came out of discussion with other pilots who I am encouraging to participate in this initiative).
12.11.2025, 10:13 - +49 1573 4866279: Because the equalisers are not based on real world performance of existing models but theoretical maximum performance of future models if only scale effects are penalising small sizes and not the lack of r&d playing into it right now as well
12.11.2025, 10:32 - Julien Garcia: This is the plan
12.11.2025, 10:47 - +49 1515 7868601: I think I am starting to get an idea of what @⁨~Ginseok song⁩ was trying to say:

The problem is not the equalizers in general but the "fine-tuning/adjustments" that is talked about to happen afterwards to equalize performance between sizes in reality. This would then be rather equalizing the Enzo 3 performance as it is a very dominant model currently rather than being a pure equalization to compensate the disadvantages implied by the laws of physics when scaling.
12.11.2025, 11:01 - +44 7771 620620: I deeply dislike the idea of equalisers . I think it’s a counter intuitive & counter productive step that will be gone ( if it ever gets into acceptance ) within a couple years .
I understand Mr Gin’s point of view and I understand Luc’s . Both have validity .
But this whole shit show will drive wedges between us all, dividing and CIVL will conquer…
This burns Oxygen and good will towards the overarching drive to make comps safer & remove poor decisions by CIVL . I suspect we have lost several hundred more enthusiastic ‘pilots for change’ in these recent lengthy exchanges.
I think it should be confined to a theoretical debate group and we put our energy’s towards more productive ‘easier to understand’ issues.
12.11.2025, 11:03 - Julien Garcia: Yes if we feel like I believe we can now close this free talk group and leave it for votes. <Ta wiadomość była edytowana>
12.11.2025, 11:03 - Julien Garcia: We are almost done with pages and website.
12.11.2025, 11:04 - Julien Garcia: It's better anyway to have vote without this chat influence
12.11.2025, 11:05 - Julien Garcia: Thanks anybody for the participation. In spite of what has been said, I believe the exchange quality was very high. New arguments, new studies, new point of views. All in a respectfull manner. You guys are great. 👏🏻
