# CIVL PRESIDENT

“In summary, the CIVL Bureau does not believe that re-introducing the ballast limit by itself is
the best way forward. We simply believe that it is better than ignoring the clear safety issue
associated with pilots carrying excessive ballast.” **Bureau Position on Ballast - email 10/30/**

## PAST RULES - FAI

**8.5.4 Ballast** Pilots must comply with the weight limitations set by the glider airworthiness standards. FAI
Sporting Code, Section 7A - 1st May 2018 33 The pilot’s weight is defined as body weight when dressed in
jeans, shirt and underwear. Weight can be measured at take-off or landing at the request of the organisers.
Pilots may carry jettisonable ballast only in the form of fine sand or water. A pilot must avoid dropping ballast
at any time or in a manner likely to affect other competing gliders or third parties. The total weight, including
all flight equipment and glider, must not exceed 33 kilograms in addition to the pilot’s weight. As an
exception, all pilots are allowed to ballast up to a total weight of 95 kg including all flight equipment and
glider. It is the pilot’s responsibility to ensure they have the competence and fitness to launch unaided at this
total weight. Sporting Code section S7 9.14 and 9.15 apply.

## Competition Pilots Union It happened before!

* Random check and pilots getting penalized
* Junk and fat diet
* Drinking / eating as much as possible prior initial weight check
* Hiding additional weight during initial weight check
* Steroid use
* Getting rid of the ballast before the landing check
...


## Competition Pilots Union Some clear CONS

* No more possibility to be competitive if you are light
* 28 Kg or 33 Kg bags are still very heavy piece of equipment
* Checks mostly impossible to enforce broadly (120 pilots)
* Increase in cheat and poor ethics
