# Summary of the Meeting

**Context:**
This was one of a series of meetings (“the ballast marathon”) organized to explore
solutions to the ongoing _ballast issue_ in paragliding competitions — the excessive use
of ballast by lighter pilots to compete fairly on medium-sized wings.

**Main Presenter:** Daniel (invited by Julien).
**Topic:** “Weight Classes as a Solution to the Ballast Problem.”

**Key Points from Daniel’s Presentation**

1. **Rationale for Weight Classes**
    o The issue: lighter pilots often add large amounts of ballast to match
       performance of heavier pilots using larger gliders.
    o Weight classes could remove the need for excessive ballast by letting
       pilots compete against others of similar total flying weight.
    o The idea has been discussed for years but never implemented.
2. **Comparisons with Other Sports**
    o Motorsports and horse racing are poor comparisons because external
       energy or animal performance dominates.
    o A better analogy: _downhill skiing_ — uses potential energy from height and
       converts it into speed, similar to paragliding’s glide from altitude.
    o Other sports have natural body advantages — e.g., height in basketball,
       limb length in swimming. Not every sport is fair to every body type.
    o Therefore, weight categories (like in boxing) are an accepted way to level
       the playing field where body weight gives performance advantage.
3. **Proposed Structure**
    o Start with at least **one “lightweight” category** , perhaps defined as **under**
       **100 kg total flying weight**.
    o Possibility later for more divisions (e.g. < 80 kg, < 70 kg).
    o Scoring would mirror female and junior categories:
       § Lightweight pilots appear in _overall ranking_ **and** a separate
          lightweight ranking (i.e. can win two medals).


```
o Could be applied to Category 1, Category 2, and possibly World Cup
competitions.
```
4. **Implementation Approach**
    o Use **glider certified weight ranges** for classification (simpler and harder
       to cheat) rather than pilot body weight.
    o Announce categories well in advance (e.g. one year) so pilots can adjust
       and buy suitable gliders.
    o Do **not immediately change ballast rules** — give freedom for pilots to
       choose whether to fly up a class.
5. **Expected Benefits**
    o Reduce extreme ballast use.
    o Increase inclusivity and participation (especially lighter pilots and
       women).
    o Encourage manufacturers to design high-performance small gliders.
    o Provide fairer options without removing competitive freedom.

**Key Discussion Points and Objections**

- **WPRS Ranking Impact:**
    o Concern that separate categories could dilute or distort the _World Pilot_
       _Ranking System_ (WPRS).
    o Daniel: lightweight results should still count toward the _overall_ ranking
       (like female/junior categories).
    o Malin: disagreed — for fairness, each weight class should have its own
       WPRS top ranking rather than being blended into a single “overall,”
       otherwise lighter pilots will always rank lower overall.
- **Number of Weight Classes:**
    o Malin and others suggested that to _truly solve the ballast problem_ , several
       classes (perhaps every 10 kg band) are needed so that no pilot must fly
       more than ~25 kg above naked body weight.
    o Daniel preferred a phased approach: start with one lightweight class and
       expand later based on data.
- **Ballast Limits:**


```
o No immediate ballast restriction planned — Daniel believes pilots should
choose their level.
o Malin argued that the ultimate aim should be for each pilot to have at
least one class where they can fly without ballast if they choose.
```
- **Implementation Feasibility:**
    o Easy to verify via glider certification tables.
    o Could start with Category 2 competitions immediately; higher-level
       comps later after proper data and announcements.
- **Effect on Manufacturers:**
    o Would create market pressure for better small-size gliders and lighter
       harnesses.
- **Testing and Equalizers/MRT:**
    o Equalizer (drag-based) and MRT (Mathematical Race Time) systems are
       still being tested as alternative solutions.
    o Weight classes could be a simpler _interim_ measure while those systems
       mature.
- **Future Outlook:**
    o Possibility for sub-70 kg category if needed.
    o Discussion on whether to eventually combine or replace with equalizer
       systems once reliable.
    o Final meeting scheduled to discuss ballast-limit enforcement via actual
       scales.

## Pros and Cons of the Weight-Class Proposal

✅ **Pros**

1. **Reduces excessive ballast use**
    o Lighter pilots no longer forced to carry unsafe ballast amounts to
       compete fairly.
2. **Fairer competition**
    o Pilots compete against those with similar wing loadings, reducing natural
       advantage of heavier pilots.


3. **Safety improvements**
    o Less ballast = safer takeogs, landings, and reduced impact in crashes.
4. **Inclusivity and participation**
    o Encourages more light pilots and women to enter comps; more
       accessible sport overall.
5. **Manufacturer innovation**
    o Creates demand for high-performance small gliders and lighter
       equipment.
6. **Simple to verify**
    o Easy rule enforcement by glider certification weight range — no complex
       measuring or subjective checks.
7. **Interim bridge**
    o Allows progress while more complex equalizer/MRT systems are tested.

❌ **Cons**

1. **Does not fully solve ballast issue immediately**
    o With only one “lightweight” class, very light pilots may still need ballast;
       partial fix.
2. **Complex WPRS implications**
    o Current ranking structure assumes one overall winner; multiple classes
       would require rule and software changes.
3. **Risk of diluted prestige**
    o More podiums and classes could reduce value of “overall champion” title
       in some peoples minds.
4. **Implementation lag**
    o Needs at least a year’s notice and updates to scoring systems,
       competition rules, and pilot profiles.
5. **Unclear definition of limits**
    o Thresholds (e.g. 100 kg, 90 kg) still arbitrary without extensive pilot-weight
       data.


📊 **Conclusion**

The union meeting leaned toward **supporting the creation of at least one lightweight
category** as a _first step_ toward addressing the ballast problem, with flexibility to expand
later.
However, participants were divided between:

- those favoring a **gradual introduction** (Daniel’s view), and
- those wanting a **comprehensive multi-class system** from the outset (Malin’s
    view).

Further **data collection via website profiles and surveys** will guide the next vote after
the final meeting, which will discuss potential ballast limits and final proposals for 2026
implementation.
