    <p>We launch a Ballast marathon week !</p>
    <p>From Wensday 10/29 to 11/5.</p>
    <p>The pilot community believe XC paragliding has a problem related to ballast. Over 60% agree to say it's a wide
        spread issue, while over 30% believe the troubles are mainly for lightest pilots (below 60 Kg).</p>
    <p>It's over 90% acknowledging a problem.</p>
    <p>It's important to note we did not asked yet, what the actual trouble was believed to be ! Many points have been
        raised from inconfort, to the fact it could worsen or even create an accident...). We are gathering accident
        data to know more about it but the process will take time. Different consequence, it was often stated that the
        problem was also linked to fairness, performance matter and access to the sport for lightest ones.</p>
    <p>In any case, during last week data collection What do we want ? / What went wrong ? Ballast was mentioned into
        several threads and initiative to resolved the matter by different means. It happens some of theses proposal
        conflict with each others.</p>
    <p>By order of appearence on our plateform we saw :</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Weight classes</li>
        <li>Equalizers</li>
        <li>MRT</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A 4. has been raised lately by CIVL Bureau announcing a return to weight check and ballast limit enforced by
        sporting code.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind, none of theses 4 solutions are considered perfect because else the community would have already
        adopted one. We wanted to organise this Ballast Marathon to give anyone the chance to get a full perspective on
        theses matter.</p>
    <p>How others see things, what are the main roots of the problem they try to solve with a given solution. What's
        their data, what's their beliefs and the mechanisms which will provide actual effect on the field.</p>
    <p>We will organise 4 Conférences. 1 per specific proposed solution. Each one will be presented by a strong
        contender and firm believer of the defended proposal. The format will be 20 min presentation, and Question and
        Answers. Come and ask. We will also open dedicated page for all 4 proposals with attached document.</p>
    <p>We will organise a votes to evaluate the community support of each proposal independently in a given set of
        scope. We don't want to compare one against each other just yet.</p>
    <p>Ex : Would you support propsoal #1 ?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overall</li>
        <li>In Cat 1 only</li>
        <li>In Cat 2 only</li>
        <li>In PWC</li>
        <li>In CCC</li>
        <li>In Sport Competition</li>
        <li>Not at all</li>
        <li>I don't have an opinion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By the time we would have gathered more accident report and hopefully pilot report.</p>
    <p>It will be the moment to try to build synthesis : Is one proposal detaching from the rest ? Good to all scope ?
        Is one very unpopular in certain scope ? Are any of the proposals supported enough to be compatible with each
        others at different level ? Can we tie different solution to meet different scope ?</p>
    <p>On the last stage, we'll open a working group, 1,5 week brainstorm, draft, visio and we will try to find a way
        out with a vote.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On such difficult topics, it's the best we could think about. Failling would still provide valuable inputs for
        our institutions.</p>
