        <h2><strong>A practical solution to the ballast problem:</strong></h2>
        <blockquote>
                <p>To compensate for the performance difference between paragliding wing sizes an artificial parasitic
                        drag device in the form of a pair of foam tubes is installed on the center rear-rise lines.
                        These Size Equalizers can be easily adjusted in length according to a simple formula, with their
                        simple shape provide a well-known amount of drag and compliance can practically be verified in
                        the field.</p>
                <p>It is proposed that Size Equalizer become mandatory in CAT1 competitions to remove one of the
                        incentives for "ballasting up" to a larger size to be competitive.</p>

                                        <p>The size equalizer tube diameter is 25 mm. Printed graduations on the size
                                                equalizer tubes allow for accurate cutting to size and practical
                                                in-the-filed checks. Each graduated segment of tube is 55 mm in length,
                                                equivalent to a 2.5 kg step in <strong>rounded_weight_range_max</strong>

                                        <p>Example:</p>
                                        <p><strong>weight_range_max </strong>for an Enzo3 S is 105 kg.
                                                <strong>rounded_weight_range_max</strong> is thus also 105 kg.
                                                <strong>tube_length</strong> will then be 330 mm calculated as
                                                <strong>(105 - 90) * 22 mm = 330 mm</strong>. Alternatively the number
                                                of graduated segments can be calculated as <strong>(105 - 90) / 2.5 =

        <h6>Notes about theses polars:</h6>
        <ul>
                <li>The line drag is anticipated as optimized for each size with the expectation that size-specific
                        load-testing is likely to happen on the next generation competition wings should Size Equalizer
                        be implemented (currently load-testing is performed on the largest size only and the same line
                        diameters are used across all wing sizes irrespective of the lower load on smaller wings).</li>
                <li>The increased parasitic drag of pilot and harness for a relatively heavier pilot on a larger wing is
                        realistically taken into account using an average representation of the pilot's arms, neck and
                        helmet drag.</li>
                <li>The drag coefficient for the size equalizer tubes is Cd = 1.0</li>
                <li>The performance at full speed is not fully compensated for because the performance at low speed and
                        in thermalling is not in favor of the larger sizes. The intention being that the overall
                        performances including thermalling are similar across sizes. It would be possible to size the
                        Equalizer to a point where larger sizes would globally perform less than smaller sizes, but
                        that’s not the goal.</li>

                                        size or lines diameter or anything else included in a product is not manageable
                                        in a competition environment because there are different manufacturers doing
                                        different sorts of products whose performance and drags are not accurately known
                                        or checkable. That is why the current proposal is based on an extra separated
                                        device doing nothing else than a very well known drag to equalize performance
                                        between sizes without changing anything of the other matters of the equipment.
