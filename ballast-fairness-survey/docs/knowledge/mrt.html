        <p>10 different groups are defined based on pilot's maximal wing flying weight. Each group must tag turnpoints
            with a different radius. It's a compensation for weight performance. Heavier pilot will cover more distance.
        </p>

    <h3>Statistically controlled compensation</h3>
    <p>The software calculates automatically the distance compensation around task turnpoints. It can send a specific QR
        code to each participant according to their weight group. The compensation is calculated on the optimized task
        distance and the algorythm is complex. The difference between the lightest group and the heaviest is currently
        20% of the total task distance. The compensation is checked and reviewed statistically after events.</p>
